Home Of The Hit-Men

The sun shines on the aluminium.
I guess this
Must be the home of the hit-men

1959

Living as an angel in the
Place that I was born
Living on air
Living in heaven
Giving the lie down, the line
To the
There's my heaven

And I know
Which way the wind blows
In nineteen fifty-nine

Which way the wind blows
In nineteen fifty-nine

And the wind blows still
And the wind blows wild again
For a little child can never kill this clean
This way
And it feels like me today
Tell me
Do you feel the same?
Isabelle?
Or do you feel like nineteen fifty-nine? 
Do you feel like nineteen fifty-nine?

And the wind blows wild again
And the wind blows wild

In nineteen fifty-nine
In fifty-nine
Isabella
Do you, do you fell the same?

Come with me
Like a little child
Like another gun
Like homeless, restless, known to none, like
Way beyond the line
Like it never was
In nineteen fifty-nine

A Rock And A Hard Place

And she came to look for me
Sold me name and innocence
Took my key
And told me to follow her
Down from Igor with her bangles and her reference
One from the church, from the valley of the
Well she wanted a haven and a place to hide, so I
Gave her an alibi, took her inside, but a
Rock and a hard place wait for me
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
Everything I ever did right or wrong
Hid out of sight where I belong

And I didn't have the heart to tell her why
And there wasn't a part of me that
Didn't want to say goodbye, but
Cause and effect go hand in hand with the
Devil may care but I don't mind, and I
Thought she'd never quite understand so I
Left her there that night and will she
Find me? I don't think so, no
When you go, you go alone
And I'm gone
Far away
Far away

And I didn't have the heart to tell her why
And there wasn't a part of me that
Didn't want to say goodbye, but a
Rock and a hard place wait for me
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
Everything I ever did right or wrong
Hid out of sight where I belong

Adrenochrome

We'll turn away in a passive decision
We'll take the steps through the unmarked door
A look back for another collision
But the boys of the spires
Are boys no more
Some Girls Wander By Mistake Cover Front

Not black and red boys
Frightened by the night
By the Catholic monochrome
The Catholic girls now
Stark in their dark and white
Dread in monochrome
the Sisters of Mercy
High tide
Wide eyed
Sped on adrenochrome
For the Sisters of Mercy
Filled with
Panic in their eyes
Rise
Dead on adrenochrome

We had the power
We had the space
We had a sense of time and place
We knew the words
We knew the score
We knew what we were fighting for
For the freedom
The time to choose
But time to think
Is time to lose
The signals clash
And disappear
The shade too loud
And the sound unclear
For the

High tide
Wide eyed
Dread in monochrome
Denied in spite
Disliked in monochrome
Panic in their eyes
Rise
Dead and monochrome
The Sisters of Mercy
Spite
On adrenochrome

The way is clear
The road is closed
The damage done
And the course
Imposed you

We'll turn away in a passive decision
We'll take the steps through the unmarked door
A look back for another collision
But the boys of the spires
Are boys no more

Not black and red boys
Frightened by the night

Afterhours

One more night spent on your mirror
Black Maria, in your eyes
This stuff so strange and lonely
England fades away
In your eyes

Two o'clock in the morning
Ninety-four degrees
Through the stillness, through the heat
The cars go by on Fifth and
Breathing slow
Get up off the floor and angel
Put your clothes on
It's time for us to go

Let's take a ride

=====================================================
Alice

She stays pressed against the wall so
She can see the door
In case the laughing strangers call and
Crush the petals on the floor
Alice in her party dress, she
Thanks you kindly, so serene, she
Needs you like she needs her tranks to
Tell her that the world is clean, to
Promise her a definition
Tell her where the rain will fall,
Tell her where the sun shines bright and
Tell her she can have it all
Today

Pass the crystal spread the Tarot
In illusion comfort lies, the
Safest way the straight and narrow
No confusion, no surprise
Alice in her party dressed to kill she
Thanks you, turns away, she
Needs you like she needs her pills to
Tell her that the world's okay, to
Promise her a definition
Tell her where the rain will fall
Tell her where the sun shines bright and
Tell her she can have it all
Today
Today

Alice
Don't give it away

Watch them do
The falling over
Watch them do
The standing still
Nothing but the knife to live for
One life, all I need
Give me one good reason
Give me more ssssss

(Women)
And the women come and go
(Talk)
Talking about me like they know

Bought and sold
And the world keeps turning
People cold
And people burning

Nothing but the knife to live for
One life, all I need
Give me one good reason
Give me more ssssss

Nothing but the knife to live for
One life, all I need
Give me one good reason
Give me more ssssss (Amphetamine logic)
Hit up
Steel in hand
Lit up

One life, all I need
Give me one good reason
Give me more sssssss (Amphetamine logic)
Give me more sssssss (Amphetamine logic)

Anaconda

Baby buy an Anaconda, Baby buy a thing to wear
She go walking, she go crawling, she go sliding through the air
She go talking warm and fashion, she go talking debonair but
See her face turn to a mask and passion turn to she don't care

She will, she will, she will, she will  let it take her breath away
She will, she will, she will, she will  let it take her life away

Let it wrap itself around her
Till it kill her in it's way

She will, she will, she will, she will  blow away

Baby hit the rush hour traffic, get a ride to anywhere
Baby buy the number three, she pay the man, she pay the fare
Baby hit the wild blue yonder, on the mainline, on the slide
Steal to feed the Anaconda, will not see the suicide

She will, she will, she will, she will  let it take her breath away
She will, she will, she will, she will  let it take her life away

Let it wrap itself around her
Till it kill her in it's way

She will, she will, she will, she will  blow away

Baby finger on the trigger, Baby shoot formaldehyde
Turn into a marble figure, turn the matter dead inside
Turn into a China doll, go maybe to the final ride
Baby go where I don't follow Baby to the other side

She will, she will, she will, she will  make it take her breath away
She will, she will, she will, she will  make it take her life away

Make it wrap itself around her
Till it kill her in it's way

She will, she will, she will, she will  blow away

Arms (All There Is To Fear Is Fear Of Fear)

Live your life in parallax
Live your life through the lens
Live your life in the rape room
Or the Mercedes Benz

Throw away the underclasses
Throw your love on the lawn
Everybody got locked and loaded
With the hammer drawn

Come feel the arms around you

Black Planet

(In the western sky)
(My kingdom come)

So still so dark all over Europe
And I ride down the highway, 101
By the side of the ocean, headed for sunset
For the kingdom come, for the
Black, black planet
Black, black world
Black, black planet
Black, black world

Run around in the radiation
Run around in the acid rain, on a
Black, black planet
Black planet hanging over the highway
Out of my mind's eye, out of memory
Black world, out of my mind

Still so dark all over Europe
And the rainbow rises here
In the western sky the kill to show for
At the end of the great white pier I see a
Black, black planet
Black, black world
Black, black planet
Black, black world

Run around in the radiation
Tune in, turn on, burn out in the acid rain on a
Black, black planet
Black, black world
Black, black planet
Black, black world
Black, black planet
Black, black world
Black, black planet
Black, black world

Bullet in the head

Got power to burn
Got means
Flowers to burn
Between those pretty dreams
Hold out for cover
Hold out your hands to me, for
Blood, blood money
Blood, blood money, money, money, money

Children, kiss the ring
Children, kiss the blade

Blood money

Which hand holds
Your hand? Holds
Blood, blood money
Blood, blood money, money, money, money

Black Sail

And in a gap between the stars.
There is no captain till you do.
We threw a line; we did not deep it.
They were many, we are few.

I keep my fireworks on the bridge.
Hurl the crew from side to side.
Unfurl the sail, the world is wide.
They were many, we are few.

Heave away, heave away, boys.
That's what you do.
Heave away, heave away, boys.
They were many, we are few.

Body And Soul

All your hidden faces
Your seven veils unfold
Give me forbidden places
All your tales untold
Give me ever and always
Ever and always
Body and soul

Heaven and a hope eternal
Over your heart of gold
Sun and sunset
Burning in the flame you hold
Ever and always
Give me ever and always
Body and soul

Yesterday
Today
Tomorrow
Body and soul

Give me ever the years you wept inside when cold
All the sins and secrets never cried
All the dreams you kept and the tears you sold
Give me
Give me ever and always
Ever and always
Body and soul

Your heart
Your mind
Your body and soul

Body Electric

Through the cables and the underground now
The faceless breathless calls
This is Babel, sensurround now
This place is death with walls
This place is death with walls
This place is death with walls
This place is death with walls
This place is death with walls

Too much contact, no more feeling
The Sound around them all
Acid on the floor so she walk on the ceiling
And the body electric flashes on the bathroom wall
And the body electric flashes on the bathroom wall 
Crawling to the corners where the idiot children call
See the body flashing on the bathroom wall

Burn It Down

Juggling with the ring of fire
The bullets blow holes and the flames go higher
Chase the yellow, chase the gold
The orange and the white lie in the stones

The juggling men and the idiot clowns
We will burn this circus down to the ground

Because some day I hope to turn and
Stand and watch this city burning down

Chase the yellow, chase the gold
The orange and the white lie in the stones

Burning, burning, burning, burning down

Bury Me Deep

Call it superstition
Followed and fell
Under the falling
Under the spell
Singing
Bury me
Bury me

Spoken in tongues
Of many colours
In the colours of heaven in the colours of hell, in the
Cannot, would not tell, in the
Broken temple bells, in the ringing
Oh, Marian, I can
Hear those voices singing
Bury me
Inside
Lie beside and
Bury Me
Deep

In the spoken in tongues
Cover me over
Unsung
Unsaid, not
Borrowed, broken and torn,
On the bed tomorrow, mourning
Before you sleep
Bury me deep
Bury me
Inside
Lie beside and
Bury me, bury me, bury me, bury me
Deep

Call it superstition
Followed and fell
Under the falling
Under the spell
Bury me
Inside
Lie beside and
Bury me
Deep

I bled all I can, I won't bleed no more 
I don't need no one to understand 
Why the blood run, hold 
The hired hand 
On heart 
Hand of God 
Floodland and Driven Apart 
Run cold, 
Turn 
Cold 
Burn 
Like a healing hand 
Like a healing hand 
Like a healing hand 
Like a healing hand

Crash And Burn

We slip on the vinyl
We shimmer to shine
Slide on the chrome and plastic
The hum of the powerlines
Sum of a love
Come trip the light fantastic
Crash And Burn - Live Dublin 2011 by MavEldritch

Do I drive?
Or am I driven?
Can I brake
What I've been given?
Take a walk
Turn
Talk
Or crash and burn

Everybody get a wife, I got mine
She's kneeling on the backseat, feeling fine, she's
Married to a soldier in the army of the Rhine, but
He don't know so he don't mind, she says

Do I drive?
Or am I driven?
Can I brake
What I've been given?
Take a walk
Turn
Talk
Or crash and burn

Slip on the vinyl
Shimmer to shine

Do I drive?
Or am I driven?
Can I brake
What I've been given?
Take a walk
Turn
Talk
Or crash and burn

The Damage Done

Somebody tell me about the rhythm of the 4th floor.
Somebody tell me about the rhythm of the dance floor
Somebody tell me about the perfect bomb
The royal valley on a blitzkrieg bomb
Somebody tell me how to use my gun tools
Kiss the napalm in the afternoon
Some Girls Wander By Mistake - Cover (front)


I saw the film, I saw the place
I live to work for the killing sake
When I think you're knocked, when the radio died
And the rhythm played from every side

See the rebel and the damage done
See the debris and the damage done
See the wreckage and the damage done
See the film, see the damage done

Somebody tell me about the rhythm of the 4th floor.
This is the image, this is the place
Somebody tell me about the rhythm of the dance floor
This is the way the world will end
Somebody tell me about the 
The waltzing man have dancing eyes
I need to know about the 
This is the way the world will end

Me I'm lost and the radio's dead
Now I'm relaxed and the radio's dead
The rhythms gone, the radio's dead
And the damage done inside my radio.

Detonation Boulevard

on Detonation Boulevard
through the angel rain
through the dust and the gasolene
through the cruelty of strangers
to the neon dream
long distance information
just tell me where the manholes steam
a little girl waits on my station
with a new machine
on Detonation Boulevard
I got wrecked out here
in a Eldorado
I got wired, white-walled
this hot-wired sedan
I caught something weird in Encenada
I've a brother of sorts in Torquemada
A Slight Case Of Overbombing front cover

long distance information
disconnect me if you can
on Detonation Boulevard
pink noise, white noise,
and a violet whining sound
it burns inside this car
no cops, no signs, no left, no right
no stops, no turning round
well you can run but you can't ride
you won't get far
on Detonation Boulevard
bang bang

on Detonation Boulevard
through the angel rain
through the rust and the gasolene
through the cruelty of strangers
to the neon dream
long distance information
I'll take the same
I got the fuel for the transformation
I'm a naked flame
on Detonation Boulevard
bang bang

humming AOR

meanwhile

I like Cal and his dog Napalm
I like Ike and his itty-bitty A-bomb
everybody got one, I want mine
you can order it up on Channel Nine

meanwhile, in the Sheraton,
Doctor Jeep plays on and on and on

there was a time but it's long gone
Janie got a crush on the Viet Cong
burning through downtown Saigon
me, I'm sold - down the Mekong

meanwhile, in the Sheraton,
Doctor Jeep plays on and on and on

guns and cars and accidents
the threatened witness my defence
you can sell one another for fifteen cents
well bye-bye mother, it's common sense

Dominion / Mother Russia

In the heat of the night
In the heat of the day
When I close my eyes
When I look your way
When I meet the fear that lies inside
When I hear you say
In the heat of the moment
Say, say, say:

Some day, some day, some day
Dominion
Come a time
Some day, some day, some day
Dominion
Some say prayers
I say mine

In the light of the fact
On the lone and level
Sand stretch far away
In the heat of the action
In the settled dust
Hold hold and sway
In the meeting of mind
Down in the streets of shame
In the betting of names on gold to rust
In the land of the blind
Be  King, king, king, king

Some day, some day, some day
Dominion
Come a time
Some day, some day, some day
Dominion
Some say prayers
I say mine

We serve an old man in a dry season
A lighthouse keeper in the desert sun
Dreamers of sleepers and white treason
We dream of rain and the history of the gun
There's a lighthouse in the middle of Prussia
A white house in a red square
I'm living in films for the sake of Russia
A kino runner for the DDR
And the fifty-two daughters of the revolution
Turn the gold to chrome
Gift  nothing to lose
Stuck inside of Memphis with the mobile home, sing:

Mother Russia, Mother Russia, Mother Russia rain down down down
Mother Russia, Mother Russia, Mother Russia rain down

Driven Like The Snow

Still night, nothing for miles,
White curtain come down,
Kill the lights in the middle of the road
And take a look around.
It don't help to be one of the chosen
One of the few, to be sure
When the wheels are spinning around
And the ground is frozen through, and you're
Driven, like the snow
Pure in heart
Driven together
And given
Away to the west
A white dress
'Til the river don't run
A black dress
Looking like mine
'Til the sun don't shine no more
Where the sky meet the ground
Where the street fold round
Where the voice you hold don't
make no sound, look
Snow on the river and two by two
Took a lot to live a lot like you, I don't
Go there now, but I hear they sung
Their Fuck Me And Marry Me Young
Some wild idea and a big white bed, now
You know better than that, I said,
Like a voice in the wind blow little crystals down
Like brittle things will break before they turn
Like lipstick on my cigarette
And the ice get harder overhead
Like think it twice but never never learn

And the mist will wrap around us
And the crystal, if you touch it

And the cars
Lost in the drift
Are there
And the people that drive
Lost in the drift
Are there
And the cares I've
Lost in the drift
Are there
Theirs, ours,
Lost in the drift
Are 
Driven
Driven together
And driven
Apart

=====================================================
Driver

Lay me down the long white line
Leave the sirens far behind me

Call me weird and call me Friday
Call me when the sun goes down
We will find a public highway
We will wind the windows down
Call me at the magic hour
When the morals run to ground
Effects yeild to speed and power
While the wheels go wheeling round and round

Life is short and life is cruel
But we have fear and we have fuel
We are never coming down

Drench the future on the glass
Lines across the middle
And the mountain places, ever faster
Rushing through the shame and shadow
While the pleasure flashes past
The sound that fills the big black cars
Is ours, the drum machines and fast guitars

But use your mad acceleration
We are never coming down
We will live forever
While the wheels go wheeling round and round

Call me weird and call me Friday
Call me when the sun goes down
We will fly along the highway
We will wind the windows down
Call me at the magic hour
When the morals run to ground
Reason yeilds to speed and power
While the wheels go wheeling round and round

Eyes Of Caligula

no new jerusalem
there is no us; there's only them
this is not my map at all

wrapped in sugar for her pains
no, she says, I'm wearing stains
she do mascara fail
there is a wall and you will wail

remember what you can
rain on the face
where the dogs ran
crippled all in scented lace

there were miners in the dark
there's needles in the park
eyes of caligula look on

we had wool and we had steel
we had liverpool, not ever much your england
now the chrome and we should kneel
in a home where we're not real
eyes of caligula look on

there was a north
there was a north
eyes of caligula look on

=====================================================
Far Parade

Had a sense it couldn't last
Watched the wonder wander past

Held it briefly, set it free
There is a space above me

Everything will come and go
There is a curve that I don't know
Don't need it otherwise but
No-one reads the book of lies and
No-one looks into the void as
Anything but paranoid and
Anything that you would be will
Swerve and hurt eventually
And I'm ungood if I can't shout
Without the vowels or the label out
Escorted from my desk
Unable to unheed

From heroine to heroin
Cash out and head on in to
Burlesque and snake-oil charm
Flashing lights and fakir calm
Shine your knives and sinecures
Your red-top wives, your gurning poor
As ye sow so shall ye find your
Car is burning at the mine

Decent men and women form a line and dance in time - it's a far parade
The ghost of war, the painted whore, dial up one nine one four - it's a far parade

Decent men and women form a line and dance in time - far parade
Distant men and women form a line and dance in time - far parade
Distant men and women form a line, form a line - far parade
Distant men and women form a line, form a line - far parade

First And Last And Always

See a body and a dream of the dead days
Following lost and blind
Living, far from here
Tomorrow is hard to find
And it seems like twenty-five years of
Promises and give me more
Scenes of a hand me down in
Dresses heard before
First and last and always: 'til the end of time
First and last and always: mine

Maybe it's not so easy
Maybe it's a way to long
Say, say you'll be by me
When the evidence comes along

First and last and always: my calling, my time
First and last and always: mine (echo)

(My calling)
(My time)

See a place and a dream of the dead days
A following lost and blind
Cross my heart with silver
Here's the key behind
Seems like twenty-five years of
Ever after ever more more more
Seems I wore this face for you
Far too long before

First and last and always: my calling, my time
First and last and always: mine
First and last and always: 'til the end of the end of time
First and last and always: mine
First and last and always: 'til the end of time
First and last and always: mine

Fix

Love for the party love for the nation
Love for the fix for the fabrication
Love for the corpse for the corporation

Give me love

Flood I

And her hallway
Moves
Like the ocean
Moves

At the head of the river
At the source of the sea

Sitting here now in this bar for hours
Trying to write it down
Fitting in hard with harder to come
Trying to fight it
Down the river there's a ship will carry you
Down river down stream
Down the river there's a ship will carry the
Dream
Dream of the flood
Down the river there's a ship will carry the
Dream of the flood
And her hallway

As the water come rushing over
As the water come rushing in
As the water come rushing over
Flood, Flood

Push the glass, stain the glass
Push the writer to the wall
It may come but it will pass
Some say we will fall
Dream of the flood
Flood

And her hallway
Oh, maybe, in terms of surrender,
On a backcloth of lashes and eyes
In a flood of your tears, in sackcloth
And ashes and ashes and ashes and ashes
And ashes and ashes and lies
And her hallway

Like
As the water come rushing in
As the water come rushing over

Sitting here now in this bar for hours
While these strange men rent strange flowers
I'll be picking up your petals in another few hours
In the metal and blood, in the scent and mascara
On a backcloth of lashes and stars
In a flood of your tears, in sackcloth
And ashes and ashes and secondhand passion
And stolen guitars

And her hallway
As the water come rushing in
(Like the sea)
As the water come rushing over
(Dream of the flood)
In a flood of your tears, in sackcloth
And ashes and ashes
And ashes and ashes
And ashes and ashes
And ashes and ashes and lies

As the water come rushing in, rushing in

At the head of the river
At the source of the sea

And her hallway
Like
Flood

=====================================================
Flood II

And her hallway Moves
Like the ocean Moves
And her hallway Moves
Like the sea
Like the sea

She says no no no no harm will come your way
She says bring it on down, bring on the wave
She says: nobody done no harm
Grace of God and raise your arms
She says: face it and it's a place to stay

This, this is the way it was
This, this is the way it is
When the water come rushing, rushing in

She says
She says anytime
Raise your arms
Flood

And her hallway
Like
Like

Like a million voices call my name
Like a million voices calling
Not now, not never again
Sitting here now in this bar for hours
Strange men rent strange flowers
Seconds to the drop but it feels like hours and I
Think I'm going togoing to

This, this is the way it was
This, this is the way it is
When the water come rushing, rushing in

She says
She says anytime
Raise your arms
Flood

And her hallway

She says
She says anytime
Raise your arms
Flood

Floorshow

The bodies on the naked on the low damp ground
In the violet hour to the violent sound
And the darkness the blinding the eyes that shine
And the voices singing the line on line
This is the floorshow the clapping hands
Animal flow from the animal glands
In the violet hour to the violent sound
Going round and around and around and around and 

I feel the bite I feel the beat I see the dancing feet
I feel the light I feel the heat I see the new elite
I see the final floorshow I see the western dream
I see the faces glow and I see the bodies steam

See them shimmy see them go
See their painted faces glow
Slow slow quick quick slow
See those pagans go go go go go

This is the floorshow the last ideal
It's populist got mass appeal
The old religion redefined
For the facile futile totally blind

Mundane by day inane at night
Pagan playing in the flashing light
In the violet hour to the violent sound
Going round and around and around and around and 
The bodies on the naked on the low damp ground
In the violet hour to the violent sound
And the darkness the blinding the eyes that shine
And the voices singing line on line

See them shimmy see them go
See their painted faces glow
Slow slow quick quick slow
See those pagans go go go go go

=====================================================
Giving Ground

Giving, Giving, Giving, Giving, Giving, Giving, Giving, Giving
In the place, through which we wander
Reason turned around
And every fool
Will see his madness drowned
And every truth is swallowed up
By gently giving ground

What you have lost can never be found
Words are just dust in deserts of sound
Everything is lost and your choice lies broken
And the truth is drowned

I watch
Surrender
Because I know

And now I know you will not see
The madness we have seen
Now I know you cannot be
All that your flight has been

What you have lost can never be found
Words are just dust in deserts of sound
Everything is lost and your choice lies broken
And the truth is drowned


Words are just dust
I stood but you just could not wait
Behind
Because I know you cannot be
All that your flight has been

What you have lost can never be found
Words are just dust in deserts of sound
Everything is lost and your choice lies broken
And the truth is drowned

Everything is lost in the giving ground
Everything is lost
Everything is lost in the giving ground
Turned around
Reason, turned around
In the giving ground
Ground
In the giving ground
Everything is lost
In the giving ground

=====================================================
Good Things

The cracks appear along the wall wall wall wall wall
See the people stoop back, once stood tall tall tall tall tall
I see the buildings crumble see the empires fall
But I see no more and I don't recall

Because I see
Nothing but the good things
Because I see
Nothing but the good things
Because I see
Nothing but the good things
Nothing but the good good good
Nothing but the good things

Well nothing ventured nothing lost
Count the changes count the cost
A reformation so uncertain
Keep your station draw the curtain

Because out there the snipers work the ridges
Building bombs and blowing bridges
Out there on a darkened road
The lines are dead and the cars explode

But in here
There's nothing but the good things
In here
Nothing but the good things
In here
Nothing but the good things
Nothing but the good good good good good
Nothing but the good things

I see a green sea a pleasant land land land land land
Nothing legal underhand
On the fence or in the sand
Well I take no chances and I take no stand

Against the wall
Against the wire
Against the fall
Against the fire
Against the sale
Against the hire
They say the profits high
But I know the cost is higher

Still I see
Nothing but the good things
Still I see
Nothing but the good things
Still I see here see do talk see
Nothing but the good things
Nothing but the good good good good good
Nothing but the good things
Nothing but the good things
Nothing but the good good good good things
No!

Heartland

Lay me down the long white line
Leave the sirens far behind me
Paint my name in black and gold
My heart my flame my heart my road
My heartland fade across the line
Heartland sing the faces shining
In the failing failing failing
Heartland make the places mine

Clearly now the past mistakes
The giant steps we had to take
The path that ever promise made to
Die in dream dissolve and fade

My heartland heartland heartland
My heartland heartland heartland
My heartland heartland heartland
My heartland heartland heartland

Behind the lines a face that glimmers
Still looking for a face that shines
In the promise in the places
I'm going to make them mine

My heartland heartland heartland
My heartland heartland heartland
My heartland heartland heartland
My heartland heartland heartland
My heartland heartland heartland
My heartland heartland heartland
My heartland heartland heartland
My heartland heartland heartland
My heartland heartland heartland
My heartland heartland heartland
My heartland heartland heartland
My heartland heartland heartland
My heartland heartland heartland
My heartland heartland heartland
My heartland heartland heartland

I Have Slept With All The Girls In Berlin

Shake me down again
Shake me down and then
Shake me down again
I can wake up in this zoo

I've been used and abused
I've been chased and I've been bruised
I can take what I've been to
I've been naked on the news
I've been debased and disabused
Just leave me downtown when you're through

Turn me over
Turn me in
I have slept with all the girls in Berlin

Girls on smoke and girls on weed
Girls on coke and girls on speed
Girls who choke and girls who smile
Girls who swallow in denial
Girls in crisis, ultra-hipped
Weird as Isis, wide as Egypt
Girls in cars and girls on ships
Girls in bars and girls on strips
Girls on journeys, girls on trips
Girls on gurneys, girls on drips
And a girl too far with pale blue lips so shake me down again

Girls like you with poison tips
Girls like you like pistol whips
Girls in over-zealous green
With a third degree in jealousy so

Turn me over
Turn me in
I have slept with all the girls in Berlin
      
=====================================================
I Was Wrong

You say stay and never leave
You say meant for ever
I could believe you, but I don't
You say we're almost all alone together
All alone
You say
You say you will
I know you won't

I was wrong
I was wrong to ever doubt
I can get along without
I can love my fellow man
But I'm damned if I'll love yours

In a bar that's always closing
In a world where people shout
I don't wanna talk this over
I don't wanna talk it out
I was quite impressed until I hit the floor
Isn't that what friends are for?
Pain looks great on other people
That's what they're for

I was wrong
I was wrong to ever doubt
I can get along without
I can love my fellow man
But I'm damned if I'll love yours

I was wrong
I was wrong to ever doubt
I can get along without
I can love my fellow man
But I'm damned if I'll love yours

In a bar that's always closing

I don't wanna talk it out

That's what they're for

Kiss The Carpet

She got red eyes
She wear dust
I went over over over over
I went bust
I kissed I kissed the carpet
I climbed the curtain
I was sure
I was certain
And I said
Yeah

She got red eyes
She wear dust
I went over over over over
I went bust
I kissed I kissed the carpet
I climbed the curtain
I was sure
I was certain
But I said
Next time I look before I
Next time the carpet
Next time I look before I
Kiss the carpet should I
Kiss

Lights

The lights shine clear through the sodium haze
The night draws near and the daylight fades
Ignore the voices, discard the day
For the brand new darkness, for the bright new way
Hit
There have been better plans, but
None that I could ever understand
Emerald signal, the green on black, the
Lights say move, say never look back and so I
Find another place where I've never been seen
Find another place where the red turns green, where the
Emerald glistens through the darkness again, where the
Emerald glistens through the rain


The lights shine clear through the sodium haze
The night draws near and the daylight fades, but there's a
Voice in the distance, quiet and clear, saying
Something that I never ever wanted to hear


There have been better plans, but
None that I could ever understand, I see the
Emerald, see the signal, see the green on black, I see the
Lights say move, say never look back and so I
Find another place where I'll never be seen
Find another place where the red turns green, where the
Emerald glistens through the darkness again, where the
Emerald glistens through the rain, rain, rain and I'm
Happy here
In the rain
In the rain
In the rain, rain, rain, I'm happy here
In the rain
Where the emerald
Glistens
Through the rain

Train

Train
Train
Train

Take a walk downtown to where the victims go

Take a last decision and the cars to move it
Past information
Tunnel vision and the scars to prove it
Everybody got a reservation

Far beyond the black horizon
Beyond the things you know
Everybody got a destination
Everybody got a place to go

Take a walk downtown to where the victims go
Take your shadow to the end to the very last window
Everybody got friends got shot upside and over
Down the line
Everybody got assignations
I got mine

Take a railway track to the main attraction
Cut a hole between the ground and sky
Take a one way ticket to the pain reaction
Cross my heart and take a ride

Far beyond the black horizon
Beyond the things you know
Everybody got a destination
Everybody got a place
To go

Lucretia, My Reflection

I hear the roar of a big machine
Two worlds and in between
Hot metal and methedrine
I hear empire down
I hear empire down

I hear the roar of a big machine
Two worlds and in between
Love lost, fire at will
Dum-dum bullets and shoot to kill, I hear
Dive, bombers, and
Empire down
Empire down

I hear the sounds of the city and dispossessed
Get down, get undressed
Get pretty but you and me,
We got the kingdom, we got the key
We got the empire, now as then,

We don't doubt, we don't take direction,
Lucretia, my reflection, dance the ghost with me

We look hard
We look through
We look hard to see for real
Such things I hear, they don't make sense
I don't see much evidence
I don't feel. I don't feel. I don't Feel

A long train held up by page on page
A hard reign held up by rage
Once a railroad
Now it's done...

I hear the roar of a big machine
Two worlds and in between
Hot metal and methedrine
I hear empire down...

We got the empire, now as then,
We don't doubt, we don't take reflection,
Lucretia, my direction, dance the ghost with me...

Marian (Version)

In a sea of faces, in a sea of doubt
In this cruel place your voice above the Maelstrom
In the wake of this ship of fools I'm falling further down
If you can see me, Marian, reach out and take me home.....

I hear you calling Marian
Across the water, across the wave
I hear you calling Marian
Can you hear me calling you to
Save me, save me, save me from the
Grave...
Marian

Marian, there's a weight above me
And the pressure is all too strong
To breathe deep
Breathe long and hard
To take the water down and go to sleep
To sink still further
Beneath the fatal wave
Marian I think I'm drowning
This sea is killing me

I hear you calling Marian
Across the water, across the wave
I hear you calling Marian
Can you hear me calling you to
Save me, save me, save me from the
Grave...
Marian

= in German:	
What I can and what I could do
I just don't know anymore
Give me something beautiful again
Drag me from the sea
I hear you calling, Marian
Can you hear me screaming?
I am here alone
I hear you calling, Marian
Without your help I am lost in this place

I hear you calling Marian
Across the water, across the wave
I hear you calling Marian
Can you hear me calling you to
Save me, save me, save me from the
Grave...
Marian
Marian

More

Some people get by
With a little understanding
Some people get by
With a whole lot more
I don't know
Why you gotta be so undemanding
One thing I know
I want more
I want more

(and I need all the love that I can't get to)
(and I need all the love I can get)
(and I need all the love that I can't get to)

D'you get scared to feel so much?
To let somebody touch you?
So hot, so cold, so far so out of control
Hard to come by, and harder to hold

Some people get by
With a little understanding
Some people get by
With a whole lot more
I don't know
Why you gotta be so undemanding
I want more

(and I need all the love I can get)
(and I need all the love that I can't get to)
(and I need all the love I can get)
(and I need all the love that I can't get to)

There are parts of me that don't get nervous
Not the parts that shake
You won't get what you deserve
You are what you take
Learning to cry for fun and profit
I'm not done yet
Counterfeit dollars or the English zloty
Anything I can get

Some people get by
With a little understanding
Some people get by
With a whole lot more
I don't know
Why you gotta be so undemanding

(and I need all the love I can get)

All the love that you can get
All the love
That I can't get to...

And I need
All the love

Neverland

And when your nerves break your thought
And my word break your will
And the heart break me over this wheel

They are coming down
Wait for
Hand in hand in hand in hand

They are coming down
Wait for

They are coming down
But we will
Never never never land

I had a face on the mirror
I had a hand on the gun
I had a place in the sun and a
Ticket to Syria

I had everything within my reach
I had money and stuff
Each and every call
Too much but never enough
Tear it up and watch it fall

They are coming down
Wait for
Hand in hand in hand in hand

They are coming down
Wait for

They are coming down
But we will
Never never land

With our backs to the sky
And our eyes on the ground
With the clouds far below
No horizon around
With the wind in our face
And our arms open wide
We shall pass through this place
To the other side
All the days of our lives
All the ways of our calling
Follow...

Nine While Nine

And it's passing strange
And I'm waiting for the train
Caught up on this line again
And it's passing slowly
Killing time but it's
Better than living in what will come and I've
Still got some of your letters with me and I
Thought sometimes or I read too much
And I think you know let's
Drink to the dead lying under the water and the
Cost of the blood on the driven snow and the
Lipstick on my cigarettes
Frost upon the window pane
Nine while nine and I'm waiting
For the train.....

She said do you remember a time when angels
Do you remember a time when fear
In the days when I was stronger
In the days when you were here she said
When days had no beginning
While days had no end when
Shadows grew no longer I
Knew no other friend but you
Were wild
You were wild.....

Frost upon these cigarettes
Lipstick on the window pane and I've
Lost all sense of the world outside but I
Can't forget so I call your name and I'm
Looking for a life for me and I'm
Looking for a life for you and I'm
Talking to myself again and it's
So damn cold it's just not true and I'm
Walking through the rain
Trying to hold on waiting for the train and I'm
Only looking for what you want but it's
Lonely here and I think you knew and I'm
And I'm waiting
And I wait in vain
Nine while nine and I'm waiting
For the train.....

No Time To Cry

It's just a feeling
I get sometimes
A feeling
Sometimes
And I get frightened
Just like you
I get frightened too
But it's

(No no no) no time for heartache
(No no no) no time to run and hide
(No no no) no time for breaking down
(No no no) no time to cry

Sometimes in the world as is you've
Got to shake the hand that feeds you
It's just like Adam says it's
Not so hard to understand it's
Just like always coming down
Just like Jesus never came and
What did you expect to find it's
Just like always here again it's

(No no no) no time for heartache
(No no no) no time to run and hide
(No no no) no time for breaking down
(No no no) no time to cry

Everything will be alright
Everything will turn out fine
Some nights I still can sleep and the
Voices pass with time and I keep

No time for tears
No time to cry
No time to be afraid of fear and I keep
No time to cry

It's
(No no no) no time for heartache
(No no no) no time to run and hide
(No no no) no time for breaking down
(No no no) no time to cry

On The Wire

Now the ground comes up too fast
Too fast to meet you
In clouds of dust erupting
Thick around your feet, be careful
In the rubble in shrouds in waiting
Wall to wall to where you tread
Now the quick and the dead and the same old
Fates come calling cards away
How do you think it came to pass you
By the hard way by desire
How do you think it came to pass you by?
On the wire

I don't sleep so I don't dream so I don't
Wake up frightened
Everything is what it seems if
You look deep enough tonight and
See ...

On the wire, on the wire, on the wire I will not fall
On the wire, on the wire, on the wire I will not fall
On the wire, on the wire, on the wire I will not fall
On the wire, on the wire, on the wire I will not fall
On the wire, on the wire, on the wire I will not fall
On the wire, on the wire, on the wire I will not ....

Poison Door

Behind the door
The poison door
We search the still hours
Looking
For a place to hide (For a place to hide)
Behind the door
Where dreams collide (Where dreams collide)
Behind the door
The poison door
We sit in silence waiting
For a deadly friend
Behind the door
Where dreams descend (Where dreams descend)
And the shadows smile

Lips dark and wild
The shadows smile
And kiss the sky
Behind the door
The poison door
The puppets dance on a burning floor
Like dying flames
Behind the door
Shoot me down again

Behind the door
The poison door
We search the still hours
Looking
For a place to hide (For a place to hide)
Behind the door
Where dreams collide (Where dreams collide)
Behind the door
The poison door
We sit in silence waiting
For a deadly friend
Behind the door
Where dreams descend (Where dreams descend)
And the shadows smile

And kiss your memory goodbye
And the shadows smile
But their lips are ssss...

And the shadows smile
Lips dark and wild
And the shadows smile
Kiss your memory goodbye
And the shadows smile
Lips dark and wild
And kiss the sky

Nothing, cut, two ways ...
Possession: Taking over

Stand these pictures on your shelf and
Wear your heart upon my sleeve
Wear a dress that you can see through

Tear apart what you believe
Make a mess of your conviction

Nothing, but the debris
Cut, two ways

This way I do my lying, making up and making out for you

Ribbons

I'm lying on my back now
The stars look all too near
flowers on the razor wire
I know you're here
We are few
And far between
I was thinking about her skin
Love is a many splintered thing
Don't be afraid now
Just walk on in
(Flowers on the razor wire)
(Walk on in)

Her eyes were cobalt red
Her voice was cobalt blue
I see no purple light
Crashing out of you
So just walk on in

Her lovers queued up in the hallway
I heard them scratching at the door
I tried to tell her
About Marx and Engels, God and angels
I don't really know what for
But she looked good in ribbons
So just walk on in
She looked good in ribbons
So just walk on in

Tie a red red red red red red red red ribbon
Love
Is a many splintered thing
Tie a red red red red ribbon
Don't be afraid
Just walk on in

Six Ways To Sunday

Nothing much outside
There might be lights
Blues and twos because it's Monday

I have the right to fall down stairs
I have the right to hurt my face
I have the right to know my place

I have the right to be elsewhere
I have the right to be upstate
I have the right to wait
Six ways to Sunday

=====================================================
Some Kind Of Stranger

And yes I believe in what we had
But words got in the way
And only yesterday
As I was leaving
Lord knows I tried to say, but I've
Heard a million conversations
Going where they've been before
Seen the way that careful lingers
Undecided at the door

And all I know for sure
All I know for real
Is knowing doesn't mean so much
When placed against the feeling
The heat inside
When bodies meet
When fingers touch

All of my words are secondhand and
Useless in the face of this
Rationale and rhyme and reason
Pale beside a single kiss
And I've heard so many things I
fail to understand at all
I'd settle anytime for
unknown footsteps in the hall outside

And all I know for sure
All I know for real
Is knowing doesn't mean so much
When placed against the feeling
The heat inside
When bodies meet
When fingers touch

Because the world is cruel, and
Promises are broken
Don't try to tell me
Anything, don't try to tell me
You'll be true to me, you know the
Real truth is never spoken

And I know the world is cold, but
If you hold on tight to what you
Find you might not mind too much though
Even this must pass away and
Memories will last for years but
Names are just for souvenirs
Some kind of angel let me
Look into your eyes

Don't give me whys and wherefores
Reason for surprise
I don't care for words that don't belong
And I don't care what you're called
Tell me later if at all
I can wait a long long time
Before I hear another love song

Come here I think you're beautiful
My door is open wide
Some kind of angel come inside
Come here I think you're beautiful
I think you're beautiful beautiful
Some kind of angel come inside
Come here I think you're beautiful
I think you're beautiful
Some kind of angel come inside
Come here I think you're beautiful
My door is open wide
Some kind of stranger come inside
Come here I think you're beautiful
I think you're beautiful beautiful
Some kind of stranger come inside
Come here I think you're beautiful
I think you're beautiful beautiful
Some kind of stranger come inside

Something Fast

All the things
We never needed
I don't need them now
All the things
Were always confidential
And hidden from me anyhow

You can stand all night
At a red light anywhere in town
Hailing maries left and right
But none of them slow down
I seen the best of men go past
I don't want to be the last
Gimme something fast

God knows everybody needs
A hand in their decision
Some of us are not so sure
I seen his own held out
For a ride on television
I think he's still in Baltimore

You can stand all night
At a red light anywhere in town
Hailing maries left and right
But none of them slow down
I seen the best of men go past
I don't want to be the last
Gimme something fast

=====================================================
Still

You didn't say it made a difference
You didn't say you want me to
You didn't hear it as I hear it
And what you did was up to you

Still - if it makes you happy
Still - if it makes you glad
Still - if it makes you happy
It makes me bad

Your real has to be what you can't disprove
And you can't retake the move
And if one day you could feel you could be wrong
...I still can't write this song

Still - if it makes you happy
Still - if it makes you glad
Still - if it makes you happy
It makes me bad.

=====================================================
Summer

talking at each other
walking into walls
walking into wishful
I've heard it all before

another shade of empty
another shade of blue
another shade of yellow, sunset yellow
another shade of you
can make it summer
and make it shine

it's raining in the doorway
paint your face once more
paint the walls away now
I've seen it all before

another shade of empty
another shade of blue
another shade of yellow, sunset yellow
another shade of you
can make it summer
and make it shine

=====================================================
We Are The Same, Susanne

counting the days in the haze around you
Susanne on the wall

no pain, summer rain
I'm lost for stupid again
we are the same
give it a name Susanne

counting the days in the haze around you
Susanne let the ether fall
out of phase, I am all around you
Susanne on the wall

no pain, summer rain
I'm lost for stupid again
we are the same
give it a name Susanne

=====================================================
Temple Of Love

With the fire from the fireworks up above me
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain at hand
You run for cover in the temple of love
You run for another but still the same
For the wind will blow my name across this land

In the temple of love you hide together
Believing pain and fear outside
But someone near you rides the weather
And the tears he cried will rain on walls
As wide as lovers eyes

In the temple of love: Shine like thunder
In the temple of love: Cry like rain
In the temple of love: Hear my calling
In the temple of love: Hear my name

And the devil in black dress watches over
My guardian angel walks away
Life is short and love is always over in the morning
Black wind come carry me far away

With the sunlight died and night above me
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain inside

You run for cover in the temple of love
You run for another it's all the same
For the wind will blow and throw your walls aside
With the fire from the fireworks up above
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain

You run for cover in the temple of love
I shine like thunder cry like rain
And the temple of love grows old and strong
But the wind blows stronger cold and long
And the temple of love will fall before
This black wind calls my name to you no more

In the black sky thunder sweeping
Underground and over water
Sounds of crying weeping will not save
Your faith for bricks and dreams for mortar
All your prayers must seem as nothing
Ninety-six below the wave
When stone is dust and only air remains

In the temple of love: Shine like thunder
In the temple of love: Cry like rain
In the temple of love: Hear the calling
And the temple of love is falling
Down

In the temple of love: Shine like thunder
In the temple of love: Cry like rain
In the temple of love: Hear my calling
In the temple of love: Hear my name

In the black sky thunder sweeping
Underground and over water
Sounds of crying weeping will not save
Your faith for bricks and dreams for mortar
All your prayers must seem as nothing
Ninety-six below the wave
When stone is dust and air remains
the only haven you can trust

And the devil in a black dress watches over
My guardian angel walks away
Life is short and love is always over in the morning
Black wind come carry me far away

With the fire from the fireworks up above
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain
You run for cover in the temple of love
I shine like thunder cry like rain
And the temple of love grows old and strong
But the wind blows stronger cold and long
And the temple of love will fall before
This black wind calls my name to you no more

In the temple of love you hide together
Believing pain and fear outside
But someone near you rides the weather
And the tears he cried will rain on walls
As wide as lovers eyes

In the temple of love: Shine like thunder
In the temple of love: Cry like rain
In the temple of love: Hear the calling
And the temple of love is falling
Down

Torch

And now the torch
And shadows lead
Were it not so black and not so hard to see
How can it help you when you don't know what you need
How can anybody set you free?

Would you walk upon the water
If he couldn't walk away?
And would you
Would you carry the torch
For me?

And what if I gave you the key
To the doors of your design...
Lit the corridors of desire?
What if not so black
And not so hard to see
What used to you then any fire?

Would you walk upon the water
If he couldn't walk away?
And would you
Carry the torch for me?

Would you walk upon the water
If he couldn't walk away?
And would you
Would you carry the torch for me?

Would you carry the torch
For me?
Would you carry the torch
For me?
Would you carry the torch
For me?

=====================================================
Under The Gun

You don't have to say you're sorry
To look on further down the line
Into the sun
Too close at heaven
Love is fine
But you can't hold it like a...

Two worlds apart two together
Into that good night kiss away
One takes the hard, one the other
Kiss away

Are you living for love?
Are you living for love?
When the road gets too tough
Is your love strong enough?

Are you living?
Are you living for love?
Are you living for love?
(Repeat)

Do you feel your head is full of thunder?
Questions never end?
Empty nights alone?
No wonder
It all comes back again

Are you living for love?
Are you living for love?
I've been under the gun
I've lost and I've won
(Repeat)

(two, three, four)

Forget the many steps to heaven
It never happened and it ain't so hard
Happiness is a loaded weapon and a
Short cut is better by far
Explosive bolts, ten thousand volts
At a million miles an hour
Abrasive wheels and molten metals
It's a semi-automatic, get in the car
Corrosive heart and frozen heat

We're worlds apart where we could meet

Where the street fold round and the motors start
And the idiot wields the power
Where the chosen hold the highest card
On the field of honour where the ground is hard
So the highest hand is joking wild
And the house soon fold and no one stand
I put my finger on and dialed
The tower, the moon, the gun and
Nine nine nine, singer down
Cloudburst and all around
The first are last, the blessed get wired
The best is yet to come
I put my finger on and fired
Heat-seeking, out of the sun
You can set the controls for the heart or the knees
And the meek'll inherit what they damn well please
Get ahead, go figure, go ahead and pull the trigger
Everything under the gun

Valentine

The razor bites and the shriek subsides
He arches clutching at his sides
Across the floor, across the tiles
The man is dead and the razor smiles
A shiny love song, a quick incision
Cut him down on television

A people come to this
Beyond the age of reason
A people fed on famine
A people on their knees
A people eat each other
A people stand in line
Waiting for another war and
Waiting for my Valentine

For a million empty faces
For a million hollow smiles
Cancer for my education
Watch the body hit the files
Waiting for another war and
Waiting for my Valentine

=====================================================
Vision Thing

Twenty-five whores in the room next door
Twenty-five floors and I need more
I'm looking for the can in the candy store
Two thousand Hamburg four
And colours I ain't seen before

It's a small world and it smells funny
I'd buy another if it wasn't for the money
Take back what I paid
For another motherfucker in a motorcade

In a long black car
With the prettiest shit
From Panama
When the sirens wail
And the lights flash blue
My vision thing come
Slamming through

It's a small world and it smells bad
I'd buy another if I had
Back
What I paid

For another motherfucker in a motorcade
Slamming through
Slamming through

What do we need to make our world come alive?
What does it take to make us sing?
While we're waiting for the next one to arrive?
One million points of light
One billion dollar
Vision Thing

Another black hole in the killing zone
A little more mad in the methedrome
One blinding flash of sense
Just like the president's
Well, I don't mind
Out of my mind
Blizzard king
Bring it on home

It's a small world and it smells bad
I'd buy another if I had
Back
What I paid
For another motherfucker in a motorcade

And a vision thing
And a vision thing
And a ...
Sha la la la

What do we need to make our world come alive?
What do we need to make us sing?
While we're waiting for the next one to arrive?
One million points of light
One billion dollar Vision Thing

Sha la la la

=====================================================
Walk Away

And in the summer when the clouds show through
I might go the same way too if
You and I could talk together
Well what am I supposed to do with
You and I would walk together
Then with always close around and
Now you gaze toward the doorway
When the weather comes falling down
First And Last And Always - Cover (front)

And when the rain comes down
Would you choose to walk or stay
Would you choose to walk
Would you choose to stay
Would you
Walk walk walk walk walk away
(away) (away) away away (away) away
away away walk away
Would you choose to walk away

And when the rain comes down
Would you choose to walk or stay
Would you choose to walk
Would you choose to stay
Would you
Walk walk walk walk walk away

Though when the day is nearly
Through I might see the same way too if
You would name the things
That bring you down on me so I could say it's
Not quite true if you don't really
Know or understand the circumstance
Behind then I might clear your
Mind and you won't have to go so

So when the rain comes down
Would you choose to walk or stay, would you
Choose to walk, would you choose to stay, would you
(away) (away) away away (away) away
away away walk away
Would you choose to walk away

War On Drugs

looking out the morning I can see the trees, turn orange in the rays
don't need the smell of incense, in the morning haze
head on down the delta, in the shadow of the sun
seven shades of shiva rising, I am come

wah-hoo
let's do the war on drugs
wah-hoo
let's do the war on drugs
seven shades of shiva rising
let's do the war on drugs

looking out the morning I can see the trees, turn orange in the rays
don't need the smell of incense, in the morning haze
head on back to Kirkstall, in the shadow of the sun
seven shades of shiva rising, I am come

wah-hoo
let's do the war on drugs
wah-hoo
let's do the war on drugs
seven shades of shiva rising
let's do the war on drugs

=====================================================
Watch

Here's the story
No time to lose (like the present)
Now I've lost my friends
Now I've lost my friends
It's not my party
Never will be
Feeling out-of-place
I'm not happy
A touch of the storm cloud...
Roughage in a comradeship and conversations
Conversations, everything's so run-of-the-mill
We stand still...

And time slips back
And time slips back...
Back to the garden
Time slips back
Back in the dark rooms
Time slips back
Back in the dark room
Back to the dark age
Put me on the rack
We stand still
Time slips back
Recount movements
Recount movements
Watch us grow
Watch us fall from grace
Watch us fall flat on our face
But you always fall on your feet
Tell me how you always
Fall on your feet
Tell me how
Tell me how
Tell me how
Oh tell me how

=====================================================
When You Don't See Me

When you don't see me...
It's not a matter of going to grow
It's not a matter of time or how I feel
I'm throwing off the shadow of a better man now
What you see is what you never had
Get real
Get another

I don't exist when you don't see me
I don't exist when you're not here
What the eye don't see won't break the heart
You can make believe when we're apart
But when you leave I disappear
When you don't see me...

Oh, it's kind of different when your there
You can lease the peace of mind
You bought a mask, I put it on
You never thought to ask me
If I wear it when you're gone
Get real
Get another

I don't exist when you don't see me
I don't exist when you're not here
What the eye don't see won't break the heart
You can make believe when we're apart
But when you leave I disappear
When you don't see me...

You never learned
You bought me
Everything and less
I turned
You couldn't let me move
I guess, I don't deny, it don't disprove
What you see is what you lost
If I were you I wouldn't try
Get real
Get another

I don't exist when you don't see me
I don't exist when you're not here
What the eye don't see won't break the heart
You can make believe when we're apart
But when you leave I disappear
When you don't see me...

Wide Receiver

And you say
Where is my believer
Waiting for the sign
Straight off the ground
With his hands in the air
And the sky for a wire
All tattered and torn
Your feet never bleed
You say never mattered
And the morning found
Your reign is over
In the hour of time

And where's your wide receiver
Over the line

Where's your wide receiver
Over the border
Where's your wide receiver
Over the line
Where's your wide receiver
Over the edge and
Too far forward
Where's your wide receiver
Over the line

=====================================================
Will I Dream?

something will happen here
I can feel it
on the howling edge of pink and white and blue
something, right here
I can feel it
and now it's just too real to
still believe in you

and will I ...dream?
when it's over will I dream?

when it's over will I?
when it's happened will I?
when it's over will I dream?

something is happening here
I can feel it
on the howling edge of pink and white and baby -
will I ...dream?
when it's over will I dream?

when it's over will I?
when it's happened will I?
when it's over will I dream?

something has happened here
I can feel it

on the howling edge of pink and white and steely blue
something, right here
I can feel it
and now it's just too real
to will belief in you

and will I ...dream?
when it's over will I dream?

when it's over will I?
when it's happened will I?
when it's over will I dream?

You Could Be The One

All gods children give good phone
I called Jesus, he's not home
So I'm so pleased to talk to you
Trees and walks I love them too
Threatened species they adore me,
Flower children never bore me
But all the this you share
Are better left unsaid
When you can give me there
And run your fingers through my hair

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, You could be the one
We can meditate
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, You could be the one
Let's call it fate
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, You could be the one
To get your flowers pressed
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, You could be the one
Just get undressed

I'm so glad to find you here
Mystic people they're so dear
I don't like the rest
Your signs the best
Whatever it is
I'm most impressed
I don't need to understand
The laying on of hands
I'm in a hurry to get my collar straight
Life is short and I can't wait
But don't worry about the state
Of this pretty little thing in the armour plate

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, You could be the one
We can meditate
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, You could be the one
Let's call it fate
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, You could be the one
To get your flowers pressed
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, You could be the one
Just get undressed

I'm so pleased that you believe
Just open up a little let the good times in
We're, going fo a ride
Destiny can't be denied
But all those precious things are better left unsaid
When you can keep me here
And run your fingers though my hair

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, You could be the one
We can meditate
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, You could be the one
Let's call it fate
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, You could be the one
To get your flowers pressed
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, You could be the one
Just get undressed

Love, is all you need.

On The Beach

in the fever dreams of alice I have seen the walking dead
I have been there at the border whither malice goons are led
I have seen them dig their boonies where the ignorants are bred
do them in the head

we are rievers by conviction, we're believers in the bus
we will steal what we cannot buy when all is stole from us
we are whole in our fracture, we are even in our each
when dog eat dog we're honoured on the beach

a thousand thousand souls have never seen the sea
you'll never hurt more as damnation's hi-viz entity
transaction's tabard's not a thing to keep you keep afloat
the chevaliers are on a boat
it's not your boat

all states have a border
that's the reason
that's the order
inside and outside, on the beach

we're parked and yet we're not
we're on the sand
this can go two ways
understand

=====================================================
When I'm On Fire

I know I'm wetter when it rains
I know I'm better with the pain

And when I stand and raise my hand
There is no god but where I am
And I know
When I'm on fire

Theres A Door

Anna moved. Shes got a carpet.
It isnt on the floor.

You have the freedom to be living in a car
Not made here any more.
Theres a door.

And did you do the do the payments?
Did you love her less as such?
Because theres carpet on her wall it dont mean much?
Theres a door.

=====================================================
Here

Creatures of tinsel and gauze
Lametta to the max

A neon Faust to you, and just because
We beat your body to the rack

So observe
While we reach for our unravel
We get to teach you what you know
You need reminding though
We will let a little show
Do we hit a nerve or do we hit a vein?


Tinsel and vain
We are here


Lametta and vendetta
We are here

=====================================================
Don't Drive On Ice

Long slow carambolage
Thats not waving, that is drowning
Your truck is underwater, outside of any town
Wind the windows down
Cant wind the windows down

From the wrong side
Dont drive on ice
Flame on the other side
Dont drive on ice
Youre looking at a river
Dont drive on ice

Its all electric
There were sparks and then there werent
You took the bridge and it is burnt

=====================================================
