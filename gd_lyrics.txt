A Deeper Blue

The colours fade
Somewhere inside
These shades of grey
Were once black and white
How many more have passed this way only to find
What they were looking for disappear before their eyes

Show me where the colours fly
And disappear from view
Paint the endless sky a deeper blue
A deeper blue

The colours fade
Somewhere inside
And the promise made
In your eyes
How many times have i heard these words before
And how many times have i picked myself up off the floor

But when i look into your eyes
I know it's true
Surrender to surprise
A deeper blue
A deeper blue

Across the sea the great divide
Through time i'll follow you
Lost forever in your eyes
A deeper blue
A deeper blue, a deeper blue…

=====================================================
Blood Still Flows

There comes a time when it's too late
To turn back the clock and start again
We can talk and talk all day
But what more is there to say

Somehow we've grown apart and it will never be the same
There's no point starting all over again

Let me go
Let me go

What in the world made me stay here
God only knows
These four walls could tell a tale
When all your words have failed

I know it's hard, it's hard for me to say
But these four walls are all that remain

Let me go
Let me go

One of these days I hope you'll see
Maybe it's better this way
In your heart I'm sure you know
In your heart the blood still flows

And life will carry on no matter what you say
There's no use starting all over again

Let me go
Let me go

=====================================================
Celebrate

And in the here and now
Where the dream is sold
I lay my money down
And so the truth is told
Is it a crime oh say it isn't so
Killing time the only way I know

And when it all comes down
No matter what they say
The truth can still be found
When nothing else remains
It shines unseen
In my heart I know it's right
Shine for me this starless night

Celebrate, celebrate open your heart
Celebrate, celebrate open your heart
And let the feeling flow
Don't stand and look for words to say
Forget all that you know
Celebrate this final day

Only now, now I can see your face
Tonight is ours, let tomorrow wait

Celebrate, celebrate open your heart
Celebrate, celebrate open your heart
And let the feeling flow
Don't stand and look for words to say
Forget all that you know
Celebrate this final day

And on this hallowed ground
We've come to call our home
We build a wall of sound
And stand or fall alone
While others wait for guidance from above
We celebrate our love, love, love

Celebrate, celebrate open your heart
Celebrate, celebrate open your heart
And let the feeling flow
Don't stand and look for words to say
Forget all that you know
Celebrate this final day

Cinder Road

All the secret places
All the dreams I've known
All the golden faces melt into one
And everywhere I turn just brings me back I know
Had my fingers burned but I can't let go

I'm waiting, still waiting
Where can we go now

Cinder Road
Cinder road

All the secret places
All the dreams I've known
All the golden faces melt into one
And everywhere I turn just brings me back I know
Had my fingers burned but I can't let go

I'm waiting, still waiting
Where can we go now

Cinder Road
Cinder road

We can count the changes
Watch the world go by
I'll do what you say just don't ask me why
You're a fallen angel
Come back down to earth
You could be the answer to all my prayers

I'm waiting, still waiting
Where can we go now

Cinder Road
Cinder road

My pulse is racing
And the blood runs cold
My hands are shaking but I can't let go

I'm waiting, still waiting
Where can we go now

Cinder Road
Cinder road

=====================================================
Cruel Light

Cruel light, golden dawn
Drew the line when you were born
And all that went before fails to make sense anymore

I see them cut and die, see the flowers bleed
I see the reason why but never the need

Can't you see
Your eyes filled with a strange desire
Can't you see we're playing with fire

I wish I'd never seen the world
Through eyes as clear as these
I wish I hadn't been the one to try and guarantee

A safe and easy way, as if I knew
A better place for me and you

Every breath you take dies inside of me
Like the past just blown away
Can't you see

A safe and easy way, I wish I knew
A better place for me and you

Can't you see
The wind blows and the flames grow higher
Can't you see we're playing with fire

Can't you see
Your eyes filled with a strange desire
Can't you see we're playing with fire

=====================================================
Down To The Wire

One by one the lights go on again
One by one the lights go on again
And there beats a neon heart
In a city torn apart

Where can we run to where can we hide
When can I see you I need you tonight
I wanna know how it feels one more time
Before we go down to the wire

Come on baby let's leave this town behind
Come on baby let's leave while there's still time

Let's take that car and hit the road
Drive as far as we can go

Where can we run to where can we hide
When can I see you I need you tonight
I wanna know how it feels one more time
Before we go down to the wire

One by one the lights go on again
One by one the lights go on again
And they look like diamonds shining in the rain

And it feels so good tonight
This city's burning bright

Down to the wire
Down to the wire

Where can we run to where can we hide
When can I see you I need you tonight
I wanna know how it feels one more time
Before we go down to the wire

=====================================================
Dr Love

Stay away from my heart
From my heart

Call the truth a lie if it suits you I don't mind
Only you know why I feel the way I do inside

So tell me who you're trying to fool
I can't believe it's all for real
The more I see the less I feel

Help me doctor please
I can't take any more time
Any fool can see it's you I need tonight

How can you know what it's like
To feel the way I do inside
How can you even begin to try

Dr Love there's a fire in my hear
And a pain that never sleeps till you're here in my arms
You know the need's so great some times
I s there nothing you can do or say
Don't you know why this heart's on fire

If it's proof you need then just look into my eyes
Any fool can see the way I feel inside

Only you know why I need you every time I hear your name
Only you know why I'd steal to pay

Dr Love…

When the flames grow higher
Surely you can see
It's you that feeds the fire
It's you I need
It's you I need

Dr Love there's a fire in my hear
And a pain that never sleeps till you're here in my arms
You know the need's so great some times
I s there nothing you can do or say
Don't you know why this heart's on fire

=====================================================
Falling Again

Hear me calling through the wires again
Calling out for you
Through the sky like a bird of prey (hey hey)
Crying out for you
And I crawl on my hands and knees
Like some kind of creature possessed
Try to stand on my own two feet
But I can't seem to find the strength

The night falls so slowly now
As soft as summer rain
And it brings me further down
Hear me calling out your name

Save me I think I'm falling again
Save me
I don't know which way to turn
Save me

There's a weight hanging over me
Hanging over my head
It's too late now for charity
I'm way out of my depth

Save me I think I'm falling again
Save me
I don't know which way to turn
Save me

There's a weight hanging over me
Hanging over my head
It's too late now for charity
I'm way out of my depth

Save me I think I'm falling again
Save me
I don't know which way to turn
Save me

I think I'm falling
I think I'm falling
I think I'm falling again

=====================================================
Fool's Gold

Sleep comes easy
And takes me down
But all I hear is that sound

Here I stand beside the water
On this shifting sand
Across the sea I know
There's a land somewhere I'm sure
A place for me to go
I don't understand, I've searched high and low

For fools gold
It shines above, fuels the fire below
For fools gold
It can't be found
Ask a fool who knows

Sometimes I think it's all too easy
Just to exist and never want for more
But when it shines, deep down inside I'm not so sure
When it shines, grown men cry
There's no cure I know

For fools gold
It shines above, fuels the fire below
For fools gold
It can't be found
Ask a fool who knows

Here I stand beside the water
On this shifting sand
Across the sea I know
There's a land somewhere I'm sure
A place for me to go
I don't understand, cross my heart and soul

For fools gold
It shines above, fuels the fire below
For fools gold
It can't be found
Ask a fool who knows

=====================================================
The Grip Of Love

Look in my eyes and tell me it's over
Tell me there's nothing left inside
After all we've been through together
You know you couldn't even if you tried

You'll never free your heart from the grip of love

Remember the time you said forever
Was I dreaming I don't know
You and I were so good together
Though it seems like years ago

You'll never free your heart from the grip of love

You'll never free your heart from the grip of love

Look in my eyes and tell me it's over
Tell me there's nothing left inside
After all we've been through together
You know you couldn't even if you tried

You'll never free your heart from the grip of love

=====================================================
Heaven And Beyond

Save your tears he cried for my soul
I fear what I have done
It's time to say goodbye
To the fools I pinned my hopes upon

They'll try to break your will
Grind you down until all your dreams have gone
But you can set me free
Oh let me see heaven and beyond

We look for words to say
In a cold grey corner of the room
On the bed where we lay
I kneel and pray that morning never comes

The wall's are closing in on my heart again
Tell me that I'm wrong
You can set me free
Oh let me see heaven and beyond

So where's the sense in waiting
Only you will know
Save your tears for my soul
Take the gun, do it now, do it now
It's better now than a life slowly dying

Shot

They'll try to break your will
Grind you down until all your dreams have gone
But you can set me free
Oh let me see heaven and beyond
You can set me free
Oh let me see heaven and beyond

=====================================================
Holding On

Throw me a line, catch me falling in time
Tell me that I'm only dreaming
Just hold out your hand now
Don't try and understand how
Nothing is quite what it seems and

Something here inside of me will never be the same
You had the world in the palm of you hand
And you threw it all away

Keep holding on
Time to leave it all
Keep holding on to me now
Holding on
Turn to me once more
Keep holding on to me now

If you let go, slip away before I wake
Then there's no-one left to blame
If you let go something here inside of me
Will never be the same

Throw me a line, quick falling this time
Give me something I can believe in
Just hold out your hand now
Don't try and understand how
Nothing is quite what it seems and

Something here inside of me will never be the same
You had the world in the palm of you hand
And you threw it all away

Keep holding on
Time to leave it all
Keep holding on to me now
Holding on
Turn to me once more
Keep holding on to me now

=====================================================
I Will Wait

I close my eyes and I count to ten
But when I wake up you're not there
They say time heals well I wonder when
I don't know if I'll ever learn

All I know is that I need you
And I don't care how long it takes

I will wait
I will wait

And if it takes twice as long again
Well you know that it's alright
I will wait till the bitter end
If there's a chance you'll change your mind

And if it takes you forever
Can't you see that I don't care

I will wait
I will wait

Heaven knows that I still need you
I don't care how long it takes

I will wait
I will wait

Until the last of all my days
And the stars no longer shine
If you ask then I will wait
Till the very end of time

=====================================================
The Love I Need

I don't want the world
You know that's not my style
I was born and raised a country girl
Not the queen of the Nile
I don't ask for much
No I'm as good as gold
I don't need a love with a Midas touch
Just a hand to hold

The kind of love that I'm looking for is priceless
Can't you see the love I need

Why promise me the earth
That's not what I need
The simple things in life are worth much more to me
Just give me your word, say it's mine to keep
Give me it all or nothing baby can't you see

The kind of love that I'm thinking of
Knows no in-betweens
Can't you see the love I need

Well I'll spell it out, say it loud and clear
t.h.e.l.o.v.e.
you know I can't live without your love
without your loving to see me through
I don't know what I want sometimes
But I know nothing else will do

The kind of love that I'm looking for is priceless
Can't you see the love I need

The kind of love that I'm looking for is priceless
Can't you see the love I need

The kind of love that makes fools of kings
And brings nations to their knees
That's the love I need

The love I need
The love I need

I don't know what I want sometimes
But I know nothing else will do

=====================================================
Mirror Blind

I blow the dust off another day
The past never far away
And I see your eyes burning on

I stare at the naked flame
Can't tear myself away
And I see your eyes burning on

I've tried telling myself that it's no true
But I know what I feel, can you feel it too
Oh oh oh say you do

Can't you see it's time
I'm burning up inside

Stop, look in the mirror
Is it so hard to believe
Stop, look in the mirror
Or are you too blind to see

Broken glass on an empty road
I see the past everywhere I go
And I see your eyes burning on

You look in the glass but all you find's
Another mask to hide behind
Oh oh oh mirror blind

What're you trying to hide
Don't turn away this time

Stop, look in the mirror
Is it so hard to believe
Stop, look in the mirror
Or are you too blind to see

Can't you see it's time
I'm burning up inside

Stop, look in the mirror
Is it so hard to believe
Stop, look in the mirror
Or are you too blind to see

=====================================================
Nothing Without You

I've seen it all before
But now I know it's true
There's nothing I can do
I've seen the faces falling
If only they knew
I did it all for you

I don't know why I need you like I do
I'd let you go but now I know there's no use

It all means nothing without you
You know I'm nothing without you

Maybe this was meant to be
Maybe you were sent for me
I'm just a child who's lost her way
Open you eyes before it's too late

For heaven's sake don't walk away from me
What does it take for me to make you see

It all means nothing without you
You know I'm nothing without you
It all means nothing without you
You know I'm nothing without you

I can't face the morning
Day breaks way too soon
I'm nothing without you

For heaven's sake don't walk away from me
What does it take for me to make you see

It all means nothing without you
You know I'm nothing without you
It all means nothing without you
You know I'm nothing without you

=====================================================
River Of No Return

Where the fear and the four winds blow
That's where I'm headed now
One eye on the wheel, one for the road
And both ears to the ground
All the words come tumbling down
Down around my feet
Say a prayer little girl for your crumbling world
Before it brings you to your knees

It's too late to think about it
Too late to even try
We've come too far now
It's too late to change your mind

We're going down to the river of
Down to the river of
Down to the river of no return

Don't look now but I think we're there
Don't look down I can see that you're getting scared
There's danger in the air again
See the children play
Dancing barefoot in the rain
One foot in the grave

Who knows what's waiting for us
Who knows just what we'll find
Will you be waiting for me
At the end of the line

Chorus

We're going down, down, down…

There's always two ways open
I hope you live and learn
Sell me down the river
And watch the bridges burn

Chorus

We're going down to the river of no return
Where the four winds blow and the bridges burn

=====================================================
Spin The Wheel

Oh silver moon shine
As sure as seasons change
When the bells chime
Reason slips away
What do we know
Watch the wheel go round again
Around again

This fascination
The need I can't explain
To see your face shine
Through the tears again
Why did you go
Were our dreams so far apart
So far apart

All I hear is the call of the wild and
All I see are the walls we can climb
Never fear take the blame for a while
Save your tears, it's all a game
It's all a game we play

Just like the last time
Some things will never change
When the die's cast who are we to say
What do we know
Watch the tears roll down your face
Roll down your face

All this time I've believed and I've hoped
But all the while I've a feeling you've known
I wonder why I treat you like I do
No don't cry, it's all a game
All a game we play

With a loaded dice an empty chamber
Pain the price of tempting fate
Her favours few and far between
But who said that the ride was free
Oh no not me, these lips are signed and sealed
Oh no not me, just spin the wheel

=====================================================
Stop The World

I still can't believe that it could ever be
This way and not be a dream
I know it can't last
The world turns too fast for us
But while it does

You're mine, all mine
All I need tonight's to know you're mine

Don't breathe a word, don't change a hair
Stop the world right now see if I care
The light that shines above, let it shine for me alone
So that I know, so that I know

You're mine, all mine
All I need tonight's to know you're mine

Stop the world
We're just killing time
Let me hear you say you're mine
All mine, all mine, all mine, all mine

I'd wear your heart on my sleeve for all the world to see
Would you do the same for me
Show me that you care
Don't ask me to share you with anyone
Not anyone

You're mine, all mine
All I need tonight's to know you're mine

=====================================================
This Way Up

Without a word of warning
You turned and looked my way
Didn't feel a thing at first
Then it hit me like a tidal wave
There's no sense in trying
Trying to explain
The trouble with me
Is I'm too quick to take the blame
There I go again

You came and turned my world around
You came and turned it upside down

I remember on night
Lying half awake
I dreamt my heart was big brown box
On the side it said do not break
You came and stole it
And tore it apart
I tried to pick up the pieces
But where do you start
It's gone too far

You came and turned my world around
You came and turned it upside down

We're treading the thin line
But I don't care
Let the dead and the dreamless sleep
They've got the time to spare
My head is spinning
Spinning lie a top
Since you came into my life
It feels like a bomb has dropped
When will it stop

You came and turned my world around
You came and turned it upside down

=====================================================
Turn To Me

Like forever falling time just slips away
But I'd go through it all again if I could hear you say
Just one more time that you need me by your side
Say that I'm the one now, all you've gotta do is try

Don't you know one day
When all your friends are nowhere to be seen
You might need someone, well that's alright with me
I'll be here to walk you round whenever you're in need
Don't you know that you can turn to me

If you don't want to talk now I can understand
But if you wanna pour your heart out
I'll be close at hand
And if you call I'll come running to your side
And I'll keep coming back for more time after time

And whatever you say, I don't mind no
That's alright with me
One day you'll realise what desperation means
I'll be here to talk you down whenever you're in need
Don't you know that you can turn to me

I can hear you calling but you're so far away
Before you know it all that's left's the words we meant to say
There's no more time, no more time for us to waste
You know that I'm the one now
All you've gotta do is say

Don't you know one day
When all your friends are nowhere to be seen
You might need someone, well that's alright with me
I'll be here to walk you round whenever you're in need
Don't you know that you can turn to me

=====================================================
Walk In My Shadow

Don't tell me what I want
Don't tell me what I need
Don't say you know what's best for me
I've had enough of dancing to your tune
So listen up I've got news for you

From now on I'm gonna play to win
And I don't care what anybody thinks

You can walk in my shadow
You can walk in my shadow

What's good for you is good for me
Walk a mile in my shoes and then you'll see
How it feels, one day you'll know
I can see you laughing baby but it's no joke

From now on I'm gonna play to win
And I don't care what anybody thinks

You can walk in my shadow
You can walk in my shadow

You can tell me now how does it feel
You better get used to it coz here's the deal
When I say jump that's what I mean
And when I say, you come running to me

From now on I'm gonna play to win
And I don't care what anybody thinks

You can walk in my shadow
You can walk in my shadow

=====================================================
When I Call

Close your eyes sweet child
And let me wipe away the tears
Come and lay beside me now
The night is drawing near

And let time reach out and take you far away from here
Stop your crying sweet child
And make the darkness disappear

Close your eyes
Don't be afraid your secret's safe with me
Draw the blind, lock the door and throw away the key

When I call and the tide is waiting we can disappear
When I call maybe time will take me far away from here
When I call only you can say the words I need to hear
When I call don't be afraid your secret's safe with me
Tonight

And let time reach out and take you far away from here
Stop your crying sweet child
And make the darkness disappear

Close your eyes sweet child
And let me wipe away the tears
Come and lay beside me now
There's nothing left to fear

When I call and the tide is waiting we can disappear
When I call maybe time will take me far away from here
When I call only you can say the words I need to hear
When I call don't be afraid there's nothing left to fear
When I call
When I call

=====================================================
Where Spirits Fly

Take a chance on me that's all I'm asking
Throw doubt and caution to the wind
And we can trip the light fantastic
Come with me now spread your wings

Where spirits fly that is where I long to be
Where you and I can see beyond our wildest dreams
Close your eyes and we could almost be
Where spirits fly, beyond belief

Back in the land of the living where we're tied and bound
And the weight of the world keeps bringing me down

Where spirits fly and you and I are free
To walk the line between flesh and fantasy
Close your eyes and we could almost be
Where spirits fly, beyond belief

Take a chance on me that's all I'm asking
Dance where angels fear to tread
Sometimes I wish I could shed my skin
And leave this wounded land for dead

Where spirits fly that is where I long to be
Where you and I can see beyond our wildest dreams
Close your eyes and we could almost be
Where spirits fly, beyond belief

=====================================================
Yesterday Again

Love's a scream, frail and torn
A shallow sea we sail upon
Still we cling afraid we'll fall
Cling like the memory which haunts us all

From the start our lives were risks we had to take
Promises that only fools and angels make
And it seems like nothing's really changed
Waiting for yesterday again

Broken dreams disappear
Another loveless soul washed up here
Memories, a veil of tears
In the end failure's all we fear

I tried to talk to you but what is there to say
All the same old lies, the same mistakes
Still waiting for the time you gave yourself away
Waiting for yesterday again

=====================================================
