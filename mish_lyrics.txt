Naked And Savage

The cuckoo sleeps, hungry and wild and crawling
Through the storm that breaks
Clears away the vicious and violent heat
Breathe deep, breathe long and hard
Kiss and caress the hands that feed
Love me primitive, betray my lips
And the treacherous heart, the savage breed

Hollow eyes only cry hollow tears
And the tinselling flesh melts away
The scars and fears that the shameless years
Leave laughing and dancing
On a wasted and tattered dream
Cry hollow tears, stifle the tortured kiss and scream

Screaming in the darkness, torn and ravaged
Spinning round in circles
And in the crazy and the howl of the naked and savage

The cuckoo sleeps, hungry and wild and crawling
Through the storm that breaks
Clears away the vicious and violent heat
Breathe deep, breathe long and hard
Kiss and caress the hands that feed
Love me primitive, betray my lips
And the treacherous heart, the savage breed

Screaming in the darkness, torn and ravaged
Spinning round in circles
And in the crazy and the howl of the naked and savage

Tarnish, taint and punish me softly
Kiss the heavens where the angels tread
Love is the corpse that crawls on dreams
Rips them apart and tears them to shreds
Screaming in the darkness, torn and ravaged
Spinning round in circles

And in the crazy and the howl of the naked and savage

Savage, savage, savage, savage

=====================================================
Serpents Kiss

Foreign tongues in familiar places
Surrender the thrills to the very core
Forever young and blessed with nameless graces
A love that kills and promises more
Ash on the carpet and dust on the mirror
Chasing shadows and the dreaming comes clearer
Gasping for colour, this perfect heart

Screaming howl and the children play
A serpent's kiss for the words you pray
Whiskey and the devil and the witching hour
A serpent's kiss on that untouched flower

Searching for a haven, it's no favour
The fingers that shine
Heart beats quicker as the veils start to fall
I'll be craving, the pleasure's all mine
Candles flicker as the devils dance on the wall
Stroking the naked and the silence gets colder
Stuck on the ceiling and the kissing gets bolder
Biting my nails for fear of revenge

A serpent's kiss and the children play
A serpent's kiss for the words you pray
A serpent's kiss and the witching hour
A serpent's kiss on that untouched flower

Ash on the carpet and dust on the mirror
Chasing shadows and the dreaming comes clearer
Some kind of visitor and the neon street

A serpent's kiss and the children play
A serpent's kiss for the words you pray
A serpent's kiss and the witching hour
A serpent's kiss on that untouched flower

=====================================================
Wake (RSV)

The tried and the trusted talk of plans
Master, past and present
Heartless wordplay, and dreams of revenge
Living on the edge, the razor edge, living on the razor edge

One day we'll look back at this
And laugh and laugh and we'll die laughing
One day we'll look back at this and laugh

Pillar of wisdom and soul of iron
Alone, in the crumbling tower of power

All your friends are dead and buried, they died laughing
All your friends are dead and buried
My heart would bleed for you if I wasn't a victim
My heart should bleed for you

Circumstance, eternal, forever
For the love of god, it's a crying shame
For the love of god

Treasure the moments touched with joy
But the remember the moments, tarnished and stained
For you, sunshine, for you
It's a taste of your own medicine
God's own medicine for you
Wake, wake for you
Wake for you
Wake, wake for you my precious
Wake for you

=====================================================
Garden Of Delight

I see your dancing, laughing, naked
Sweet and pretty face
And the promise, burning brightly
In your crystal-shot eyes
Your savage, and violent flesh
The cut that bleeds, the kiss that stings
We're shooting up stars and desperate snows
That fall from shimmering skies, So

Take my hand and lead me
To the Garden of Delight
Take my hand and lead me
To the Garden of Delight

Revelation is laid, and reflects

On the windswept liquid mirror
Of this breathless world, this Happy Death
This elegance in charm
The treasured first fleeting touch of a gracious stranger
In-charmed me and entranced me
I know you can do me no harm, so

Take my hand and lead me
To the Garden of Delight
Take my hand and lead me
To the Garden of Delight

We're playing with fire, dancing in the flames
And we're covered in burns that may never heal
And angels may come, and angels may go
But it's heaven on earth when you

Take my hand and lead me
To the Garden of Delight
Take my hand and lead me
To the Garden of Delight

=====================================================
Wishing Well

Take off your hat, kick off your shoes
No, you're not going anywhere
Run around the town, singing your blues
No, you're not going anywhere

You've always been a good friend of mine and you always said farewell
But the only time that you're satisfied is when your feet's in the wishing well

Throw down your gun, you might shoot yourself
Or is that what you're trying to do
Put up a fight you believe to be right
Someday the sun will shine through

You've always got something to hide, something you just can't tell
And the only time that you're satisfied is when your feet's in the wishing well

And I know what you're wishing for
Love in a peaceful world
Love in a peaceful world
Love in a peaceful world

You've always been a good friend of mine and you always said farewell
And the only time that you're satisfied is when your feet's in the wishing well
Wishing well
Wishing well
Yeah

The Crystal Ocean

Brother of Cain, but I'm not Abel
To see the word from the trees
I'm all at sea, come hell and high water
Before I drown, kiss me please

Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake me round, and around
Shake me down

Here comes the sun, streaming through the window
Colour up the dust and making it shine
The devil's domain is the crystal ocean
Wave after wave, in time after line

Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake me round and around
Shake me down
Shake me down
Shake me down

Flesh and blood, sister in crime
Cross my heart and then hope to die
The blinding lights, done with mirrors
Reach for the blade and kiss the sky

Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake me round and around
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake me round and around
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake me round and around
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake me round and around
Shake me down

Dancing Barefoot

She is benediction
She is addicted to thee
She is the root connection
She is connecting with me
Here I go and I don't know why I float so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me

I'm dancing barefoot heading for a spin
Some strange music drags me in
Makes me come on like some heroine

She is sublimation
She is the essence of thee
She is concentrating on
He, chosen but she
Here I go and I don't know why I spin so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me

I'm dancing barefoot heading for a spin
Some strange music drags me in
Makes me come on like some heroine

She is recreation
She, intoxicated by thee
She as the soul sensation and
He is levitating with she
Here I go and I don't know why I spin so ceaselessly
Until I lose my sense of gravity

I'm dancing barefoot heading for a spin
Some strange music drags me in
Makes me come on like some heroine

=====================================================
Wasteland

I still believe in God
But God no longer believes in me

There's a crystal view from my window
And I can see years to come
I live for the burn and the sting of pleasure
I live for the sword, the steel, and the gun
I can tear down the walls, storm the barricades
Run to the place where the frightened crawl
Desire lurks beyond good and evil
So I dance on the graves where the hallowed fall

Over this land
All over this wasteland
Over this land
All over this wasteland

You can touch, but please keep your distance
You're innocent and pure and with no shame
The spirit is willing, and the flesh is craved
You tease and you taunt with the pleasure of pain

Over this land
All over this wasteland
Over this land
All over this wasteland

Heaven and Hell, I know them well
But I haven't yet made my choice
I'm feeling scared 'cause I'm shouting loud
And no one can hear my voice
I'm walking the tightwire, can't look down
Strung out high, above you all
Fateful wind blows through this land
Howls my name, heralds my fall

Over this land
All over this wasteland
Over this land
All over this wasteland
All over this wasteland 

=====================================================
Bridges Burning

Snow blind, dog tired
Snow blind, and barb wired
Last chance in the jungle trance
And the fast step of the monkey dance craze
War paint, misty days and dizzy faint
Keeping the faith, spinning turning
Watch the flames
Of bridges burning!

Turning colors and shedding skin
Shining brightly, thick and thin
Mirror of God, legend and myth
The fatal charm of the treasure
Gift wrapped and heaven sent

So trapped on islands of intent
Avenging angel of the wild and yearning
Stoke the flames
Of bridges burning!

It burning me over!
Bridges burning!

Burning, drives me wild
Yearning for the small child
Blind men cry, but shed no tears
See no evil, speak in tongues
And hear you say, "Lovers Leap"
Cos there's NO other way across waters deep!
Feel the fire and the fool is learning
To run from the flames
Of bridges burning!

=====================================================
Stay With Me

Books and covers and part time lovers
Spinning in rooms in cities of rust
I'm stranded, struck out on this line
There's smoke and fire and steel and wire
And glass and spire and dust
One to the floor at dawn with lips tied and drawn
Sleepless nights spent, with angels heaven sent

Stay with me, lay with me, lay down by my side
Stay with me, lay with me, take me deep inside
Lay with me, stay with me, lay with me
Stay, with me
Stay, with me

All of us lying there in the dreams
Speak of days and another place
I wander as the gypsy under a beckoning moon
Speak of time, and another face
They would in languid cry a fleeting furtive sigh
From the cradle to the grave love to desire and crave

Stay with me, lay with me, lay down by my side
Stay with me, lay with me, take me deep inside
Lay with me, stay with me, lay with me
Stay, with me
Stay, with me

I'll laugh for you, and I'll dance for you
But don't ask me to she'd any tears when I have to go
You are a joy and a pleasure to love and to hold
Your promises, are as pure as the driven snow
Passing shapes in the night the touch distraut and light
As you brightly shine, your love tonight is mine

Stay with me, lay with me, lay down by my side
Stay with me, lay with me, take me deep inside
Lay with me, stay with me, lay with me
Stay, with me
Stay, with me

=====================================================
Blood Brother

I gave you flowers and you gave me faith
We of minds and hearts that move as one
Chameleon, warrior, gypsy and brave
We turn our eyes to the heart of the rising sun

You and me, we are blood brothers
You and me, we are blood brothers
Blood brother, lay down your life for me
Lay down your love for me

Kiss by kiss, touch by touch
We tore the clouds apart
You took my hand and walked me through the rain
An act of love, a mission of tender mercy
We stood tall and proud together we conquered again

You and me, we are blood brothers
You and me, we are blood brothers
Blood brother, lay down your life for me
Lay down your love for me

We pulled no punch and we gave them hell
Made the fearless cry and the shameful tell
Mountains and sand and seas and land
We moved winds to calm
And we rose again to win the war to
Rule and reign our hearts to soar
Heads held high, we touched the sky and we kissed
The ever faithful moon

=====================================================
Let Sleeping Dogs Die

There's the crime of passion
And the crime of revenge
But the worst crime of all
Is the crime of regret

Speak of the devil
And the devil may speak of you
Why can't we
Let sleepin' dogs die?

Deep, it cuts deep
And the affection, it grows
And heaven only knows
What you were to earth
And the giving birth
To the giving rounds of judgement

And by fact of reason
You accuse of treason
Claim betrayal to the Holy Ghost
Of the sacred past
It's fading fast and forever

You took my hands
And turned it over
Why can't we
Let sleepin' dogs die?

No devil so dark
As the devil I know
There's no love lost
And no reason why

Talk, of faith you talk
But you were the one
Intent on stun
You took my glory and pride
Sanctity defied
And you never knew what the Gods could bring

By playing the game
Of who's to blame
It gets harder all the time
To put my trust in you
So reverence please, let sleepin' dogs die

Let sleepin' dogs die
Let sleepin' dogs die
Let sleepin' dogs die

=====================================================
Sacrilege

Tarot strewn across the floor
Fate creeps under the creaking door
Say farewell to the salad days
Arms held out for the needle haze
Scars, scars start to show
But don't, don't despair for the shame I know

Bible for the love and damned
Religion for the pagan man
Faith and prayer for the chosen few
Mystic shades of violent hue
Blood, blood on my cheeks
And the taste
The taste of ash curls across my tongue

Sacrilege, burning on the funeral pyre
Sacrilege, toss and turn on the cross to burn

Rape and pillage the sacred word
Heart of darkness crowned and stirred
Rite of passage reckless whirl
Fruit forbidden ritual swirl
And you, what can you do?
And I, I say there's nothing you can do to stop this

Sacrilege, burning on the funeral pyre
Sacrilege, toss and turn on the cross to burn

Tarot strewn across the floor
Fate creeps under the creaking door
Say farewell to the salad days
Arms held out for the needle haze
Scars, scars start to show
But don't, don't despair for the shame I know

Sacrilege, burning on the funeral pyre
Sacrilege, toss and turn on the cross to burn

=====================================================
Dance On Glass

Run you ragged
Torn and jagged
Sharp tongued, ripped and ragged
Couldn't find the party line
Gee whiz, it's happy time
Mirror, mirror, reflects me hazy
The heat's on, I'm running round crazy
Here's the road, didn't miss a trick
While you trash the punch and kick
I'll kiss the lips that sealed your fate
I'll bring you flowers and place them on your grave

Dreaming of colours, swamped in dust
Sweet dreams all covered in rust
Looking at heaven, gladdest ghosts seen
Turn to kill this crazy dream
You are revered for your work with ink and mirrors
You are renowned for bringing me steel and power

So dance, dance, dance on
Dance, dance, dance, dance on glass
Dance, dance, dance on
Dance, dance, dance
Dance on glass

Shadow boxing, mild and meek
Send me flowers, tongue in cheek
Medicine man cast a spell
Head spins round, kiss and tell

So dance, dance, dance on
Dance, dance, dance, dance on glass
Dance, dance, dance on
Dance, dance, dance
Dance on glass

Cheeks on fire, dance on glass
A touch of magic, a hint of class
Dress in leather, play in the dark
Pain and torture leave their mark
Take no prisoners, smash the light
Lunatic fringe, kiss and bite
Wild promise, cheeks are red
Battle cry, and then it's off to bed
You've taken my heart and ripped it from my sleeve
Hold it in your hands
Grip your fingers and it starts to bleed

So dance, dance, dance on
Dance, dance, dance, dance on glass
Dance, dance, dance on
Dance, dance, dance
Dance on glass

You shudder at a touch

=====================================================
And The Dance Goes On

It's no shot in the dark
And no trick of the lights
You tease me, adore me
Talking dirty, sitting pretty
Lay me down and anoint my wounds
Dust up, bust up, let's get down to the nitty-gritty

You call on favours promised and sworn
Changing names and changing places
The blade digs deep
And the cut begins to sting
There's more to this than reason
Or the old familiar rhythm and rhyme
Take me shake me lead me
To the floor and hey let's swing

And the dance goes on
And the dance goes on and on
And the dance goes on
And the dance goes on and on and on and on

We're going up in flames
We're burning up in a blaze of glory
Don't put fire into the hands
Of the weak and faint, the weak and frail
Tripping the light fantastic
Let's celebrate our great escape
For goodness sake, it's all the same
The sinner and saint, heaven and hell

And the dance goes on
And the dance goes on and on
And the dance goes on
And the dance goes on and on and on and on

We're going up in flames
We're burning up in a blaze of glory
Don't put fire into the hands
Of the weak and faint, the weak and frail
Tripping the light fantastic
Let's celebrate our great escape
For goodness sake, it's all the same
The sinner and saint, heaven and hell

And the dance goes on
And the dance goes on and on
And the dance goes on
And the dance goes on and on and on and on

Severina

She's got her head in the clouds
She's got the stars in her eyes
And she's dancing
With a dream in her heart

She's got the wind in her hair
Moon child shining bright
And she's dancing
With a dream in her heart

She believes in will of the Gods

Love Me To Death

Let me come inside your ivory tower
Let me come inside your hallowed walls
God, it's heaven in here
Fix me with your hand of praise
Fix me with your touch of precious thrills
Your fingers dance across my skin
Reaching out for the pride of man

Hand in hand, flesh in flesh
We're walking through the fire of love
Breath by breath, and flame by flame
We burn till the sun rises and shines hot
Love comes gushing, love runs free
My love comes all over you
My love comes for you

Love me to death, my flower
Run barefoot through my hair
Naked on my lips
Love me to death, my precious
Smother me with kisses
Drown me in your waves of falling sweetness

Hold me dear, bury me deep
Bless me with your word of savage honour
We love more by fate than design
So give me your hand and I'll gladly give you my life
A flower, that sways in the breeze
You must be stronger than the winds that blow you away
Blow you away

Love me to death, my precious
Run barefoot through my hair
Dance wild on my lips
Love me to death, my flower
Lay me down on your bed of petals
Cover me with your honey, my blossom

Love me to death
Love me to death
Love me to death, my flower
Love me to death, my treasure
Run barefoot through my hair
Dance wild on my heart
Love me to death, my precious
Love me to death, my love
Tarnish, taint and punish me softly
Softly love me to death
Love me to death

=====================================================
Island In A Stream

A silver moon and a singing breeze
I'm walking out under the stars
I light a cigarette and watch the smoke
As it chases my dreams away

I turn my gaze out to the sea
And watch as the waves come tumbling in
Off in the distance, an angel cries
As the ship of the line comes into bay

I'm just an island in a stream
I'm all at sea, come rescue me
I'm just an island in a stream
I'm all at sea, come rescue me

Building castles and flying flags
And my lips begin to sting
I feel the sand beneath my feet
And my Halloween heart begins to sing

The flashing light warns of danger here
But the ship comes on sailing in
I run for shore and a way to hide
I need a time and a place to think

I'm just an island in a stream
I'm all at sea, come rescue me
I'm just an island in a stream
I'm all at sea, come rescue me

I look around to find a friend for life
Seeking refuge in your arms
Splinters of ice, thin, sharp and cold
Pierce my freezing skin

By the skill of your embrace
You show me a grave new world
And against the tide and dashed on the rocks
The ship of the line comes on in

I'm just an island in a stream
I'm all at sea, come rescue me
I'm just an island in a stream
I'm all at sea, come rescue me

I'm just an island in a stream
I'm all at sea, come rescue me
I'm just an island in a stream
I'm all at sea, come rescue me

=====================================================
Beyond The Pale

Cold still waters running deep
Pale before the eyes
Ravaged
By the hands that feed
Thunder clouds the skies
Drifting with the tide
Floating with the stream
The howling winds have gathered strength
From a whisper to a scream
Sell me down the river
And out to sea
Cast me adrift and set me to sail
Just on last kiss before raising hell
Beyond the pale
Beyond the pale

Heed to Neptune's calling deceived in fable and lore
Learn from treacherous bibles
Of murder, hate and war
Searching for the tears
In an ocean of rain
The yearning of the raging sea beckons once again
Sell me down the river

And out to sea
Cast me adrift and set me to sail
Just on last kiss before raising hell
Beyond the pale
Beyond the pale

Gathering of the storm
And the winds are blowing wild
Sweeping over cross and creed, country, colour and child
Mother Nature cries for love
Her children lost at sea
And as the waves take me away
Say a prayer for liberty
Sell me down the river
And out to sea
Cast me adrift and set me to sail
Just on last kiss before raising hell
Beyond the pale
Beyond the pale
Beyond the pale
Beyond the pale

=====================================================
Wind And A Prayer

Gypsy in my blood
And I lie where the myth is sold
Cross my palm with silver
And I'll give you my heart of gold
Steal away my crystal ball
And bring me in from the cold
And it's fair to say there's no comfort here
No hands to hold and treasure dear
You could very well be the very death of me
Crawling 'round your floor
On my hands and knees
All caution to the wind
Taken by the breeze
No grave concern for repercussion
No room for talk or brave discussion

Well I never
But the devil may care
I'm coming in
On a wing and a prayer

Snowbound daze
Leaves me high and dry
And I swear there's more to me than meets your hollow eyes
Throw me a line I'm sinking fast
I'm not yet willing to die
My secret's safe with you I trust
Show me faith and give me dust

Well I never
But the devil may care
I'm coming in
On a wing and a prayer

The devil always fools
With the best laid plans
And never can I meet
With all your choice demands
It goes against the grain
To place my life in your hands
I'll take the flak if you'll take the blame

Well I never
But the devil may care
I'm coming in
On a wing and a prayer

Well I never
But the devil may care
I'm coming in
On a wing and a prayer

=====================================================
Fabienne

A sheer moon
Bless her silken heart
Waiting for the stars
To come out and shine

Head in the clouds
And she kisses the sky
Trick or treat on the tip of her tongue
And shooting the line

Fabienne, let me kiss the moon
Fabienne, let me kiss
Let me kiss the moon

The hard shine
And heaven be praised
She's pure in thought and
Hand on heart and heaven sent

Reaching for the stars
With a trembling hand
Childish eyes
Betray the love of the innocent

Fabienne, let me kiss
Fabienne, let me kiss the moon
Let me kiss the moon
Let me kiss the moon

Fabienne, let me kiss the moon
Fabienne, let me kiss the moon
Fabienne, let me kiss the moon
Fabienne, let me kiss

Let me kiss the moon

Heaven On Earth

Ever

There's oceans between us

Take to the sea, take to the sea
There's heaven before us

Float on the waves, float on the waves

Pale moon lay belief on me

Mother come give me birth
You give me heaven

And I'll promise you the earth

Heaven

Lays on your pillow

Sleep in your eyes, sleep in your eyes

Lays in the waiting

Steal every moment, hold every breath

Gentle heart beat as one

Dream for the beauty of birth
You give me heaven

And I'll promise you the earth

I'll die for you, if the time ever came

I'll kill for you and shoulder the blame
I'd cry for you and never feel shame

For the child is within
For the child is within you

Precious
I want the earth for you

Precious

I hold out my hands to touch the sky

And only the pure go to heaven

Suffer the child unto you

Forever more

Heaven on earth

Bless me my godess of love
For all your blessing is worth

You give me heaven and I promise you the earth

I pray for the second coming
Worship you for the first

You give me heaven and I give you the earth

You give me heaven and I give you the earth

You gave me heaven and I give you the earth

=====================================================
Kingdom Come

Desert rat cry me wolf
Shedding skin upon you lips
I pray
For the love of madness
For the hand that takes the grip

And we close our eyes
To forgive and forget
And we close our eyes
To forgive and forget
With bated breath for the kingdom come
With bated breath for the kingdom come

I build myself a brave asylum
And ask all the madmen to play host
And when the colours all fade away
It's time for us to give the ghost
Give up the ghost

And we close our eyes
To dream a while
And we close our eyes
To dream a while
Dream a while
With bated breath for the kingdom come
With bated breath for the kingdom come

And while we're talking in tongeus
Of animal behaviour
With a flick of the wrist you could've broken my heat
And done yourself a favour
And I cry in the heat
For the promised and given

The hand I once would trust
Now for the love of heaven
You won't see me
See me for dust

And we close our eyeas
To love again
And we close our eyes
To love again
Love again
With bated breath for the kingdom come
With bated breath for the kingdom come
With bated breath for the kingdom come
With bated breath for the kingdom come

=====================================================
Breathe

I'm living in the hope
Of a breath to be shared
It's all I've ever wanted
It's all I ever dared
So breathe
Breathe deep

Breathe
Breathe long and hard
Breathe with me
Breathe with me

=====================================================
Child's Play

Dust is the one
She provides all the fun
And we're all falling down in a heap on the floor
We're falling around
Pleading for more
And shell shocked eyes keep shooting their lies
As she lays down the law and the god given line
She lays down the law
We cut it fine

This is child's play
This is child's play

Snow in Berlin and she freezes my skin
Pick up a thought
And she gets out of hand
Perish a thought
And she makes demands

With her tongue and her frown
She dresses me down
She bleeds me dry and tears me to shreds

Bleeds me dry
And leaves me for dead
This is child's play
This is child's play
Child's play
Child's play
Child's play

She never says die and she never asks why
One thing she's learned is she's kind to be cruel
One thing she's learned
It's better to serve than to rule
This is child's play
This is child's play
This is child's play
This is child's play
Children at play
Child's play
Children at play
Child's play

=====================================================
Black Mountain Mist

Listen
To the silence
Of the breaking of my heart
From a lowly vale
To the rolling hills
You and I
Lie worlds apart
Time is catching my breath
As love bleeds slowly to death
Black mountain mist
Take me back again
Black mountain mist
Come carry me home

And sleep
Is stirring dreams
Of innocence and yesterday
When the sun shone bright
And high in the sky
And we lived in hope
Of come what may

Forever with laughter we cried
And the truth is never could we have lied
Black mountain mist
Take me back again
Black mountain mist
Come carry me home

And when the rain comes
To clear away the mist
Feel it's caress
Feel it's embrace
Feel it's wasting kiss
Black mountain mist
Take me back again
Black mountain mist
Come carry me home
Black mountain mist
Come carry me carry me home
Carry me carry me home

=====================================================
Heat

Let me lay waste with gentle persuasion
Let me lay down
To sweat in the heat
On the back of beyond we laugh at all reason
And in the light of it all
There's no need to retreat
And the heat comes down
And the heat comes down
And hand in hand
We melt in the heat
We melt in the heat
We melt in the heat
We melt in the heat

Save for the asking fortune favours the brave
Let me take strength
From the child in your eyes
And between the lines we dance into the mirror
And a grateful embrace
Layes in wait for the sun to rise

And the heat comes down
And the heat comes down
And hand in hand
We melt in the heat
We melt in the heat

We melt in the heat
We melt in the heat

Please don't take it hard when
I give myself to you
And love will come easy
When you deign to swallow my pride
Before I ever touch your lips
You promise the very earth to me
And tender hearts and broken down
When you take me deep inside

And the heat comes down
And the heat comes down
And hand in hand
We melt in the heat
We melt in the heat
We melt in the heat
We melt in the heat
We melt in the heat
We melt in the heat
We melt in the heat
Melt in the heat

Hymn (For America)

I've felt the heat

In the city of Angels

Dust up on high

And the worse for wear

I've seen the lights

Going down on sunset

Madmen running loose
There's murder in the air

So this is America

Love colder than death
Working the streets

Love doesn't come cheap

So I learn how to steal

Religion for sale

Buy my way into heaven
Sell my soul for a trick

It's not worth a great deal

So this is America

I remember her smile and her virgin heart

I remember her tears tearing me apart
I remember my hands helpless and tied

As they led her away I remember I cried

I've put my life

In the hands of a scream
Small talked and less

With legends to be
But I carried a torch
For the child forbidden

And when the heat closed in

They crucified me

So this is America

Dreams don't come easy

Without any sleep

On this damned bed of nails
Laid wide eyed and weary

I hit the freeway

And step on the speed

Head for the desert

When madness prevails

So this is America

God bless you America
God bless you America

God bless you America
God bless you

=====================================================
For Ever More

I can taste your lipstick
I can feel your breath
I can feel the shivers running down my spine
I can feel your heartbeat
I can feel your hand
I can feel your fingers dancing down my spine

I give myself to you, heart and soul, flesh and blood
For ever more

I can taste your sex
I can feel your heat
I can see the fire burning in your eyes
I can taste your sweetness
I can feel your joy
I can see the flames dancing in your eyes

I give myself to you, heart and soul, flesh and blood
For ever more
For ever more
For ever more
For ever more
For ever more
For ever more, heart and soul
For ever more, flesh and blood
For ever more, I give myself to you
For ever more, heart and soul, flesh and blood, forever
For ever more, heart and soul, flesh and blood, forever
For ever more, I give it, I give it all to you

Amelia

Daddy says "Come and sit on my knee"
Daddy says "You're the only girl for me"
'Cos Amelia, "You're Daddy's favourite girl"
Amelia, "Daddy loves his little girl"

Daddy comes in the dark of night
Daddy say "Don't be scared, it'll be alright"
Amelia, "Daddy hates to see you cry"
Amelia, "You're the apple of Daddy's eye"

Daddy says "Dry your tears and give me a smile"
Daddy says "If you're good I'll hold you awhile"
'Cos Amelia, "You're Daddy's precious girl"
Amelia, "Daddy loves to love his little girl"

"Daddy, tell me Daddy
Is this really love?"

Daddy says "Don't tell Mama what I did to you"
Daddy says "If you do I'll beat you black and blue"
'Cos Amelia, "You make Daddy feel like a man"
Amelia, "Daddy loves you more than Mummy can"

"Daddy, tell me, Daddy
How can you call this love?"

Amelia
Damn your Daddy to hell

Mumbo Jumbo

Mumbo jumbo, listen to the whispers of madness
We have climbed mountains of dust
We have seen gold gather rust
Hocus pocus the stampede of my heart
We have sailed on the stars through the air
We have flown on the wings of a prayer
Into the blue, only with you
Into the blue, only with you, into the blue

Gasoline rainbows swimming in the puddles in the street
Whichever way the wind blows we've got the whole damn
World crawling at our feet
Laughing canyons and everglades
Candle flames and razor blades
Dancing through the poppy fields, hand in hand we cascade
Into the blue, only with you
Into the blue, only with you, into the blue

There's a singing dwarf on the streets of New York
There's a shuffling man with plastic on his head
There's a preacher woman crying in the traffic
Crying for the living crying for the dead
The waste of it all, the waste of it all
And there's more at stake than we could ever know
'Cos when we're together we always fall
Into the blue, only with you
Into the blue, only with you, into the blue

=====================================================
Butterfly On A Wheel

Silver and gold and it's growing cold
Autumn leaves lay as thick as thieves
Shivers down your spine chill you to the bone
'cos the mandolin wind is the melody that turns your heart to stone
The heat of your breath carving shadows in the mist
Every angel has the wish that she's never been kissed
A broken dream haunting in your sleep
And hiding in your smile
A secret you must keep, love cuts you deep

Love breaks the wings of a butterfly on a wheel
Love breaks the wings of a butterfly on a wheel

There's no scarlet in you, lay your veil down for me
As sure as god made wine, you can't wrap your arms around a memory
Take warmth from me, cold autumn wind cut sharp as a knife
And in the dark for me, you're the candle flame that flickers to life

Love breaks the wings of a butterfly on a wheel
Love breaks the wings of a butterfly on a wheel
Love breaks the wings of a butterfly on a wheel
Love breaks the wings of a butterfly on a wheel

Wise man say all is fair in love and war
And there's no right or wrong in the design of love
And i could only watch as the wind crushed your wings
Broken and torn, crushed like a flower under the snow
And like the flower in spring
Love will rise again to heal your wings

Love heals the wings of a butterfly on a wheel
Love heals the wings of a butterfly on a wheel
Love heals the wings of a butterfly on a wheel
Love heals the wings of a butterfly on a wheel

=====================================================
Sea Of Love

Mistress of Avalon cast a spell and let the mist draw down on me
Slumber in lavender and take the primrose path to the eternal sea
The dragon's breath of shadow land
Resting on the waves and drifting across the sand

Maiden of Lorelei, the sweetness of your song calls my ship across the blue
Treasure rests upon your shore
The seagulls cry for sailors lost on their voyage to you
Harbour lies in your embrace
And my ship sets sail for that resting place
A ship of dreams on the sea of love
And if wishes are stallions
Then kisses are galleons
And dreamers sail on the sea of love
On the sea of love

Angel of evermore my saviour from the heavens above
With healing in your wings
The beauty of the melting snow the perfume of the
Mountain flower springtime brings
The ocean waves on desert shores
The coast the ship of dreams explore
Dreamers sail on the sea of love
On the sea of love

=====================================================
Deliverance

Believe in magic believe in lore legend and myth
And the hand that guides in the cunning of hope in the weaving of dreams
And the lady of the lake takes my hand and leads me
To the holy isle and the fairy rings and the circles of stone
Forever and again

Give me, give me, give me, deliverance
Brother, sister, give me, give me
Deliverance, deliver me

Surrender to the wisdom of age and the spirits of time
Remember our souls entwined for eternity
And the healing hand of the fairy queen will come to all who have faith in her
And the apple tree will bear it's fruit in the gardens of Avalon
Forever and again

Give me, give me, give me deliverance
Brother, sister, give me, give me
Deliverance, deliver me
Give me, give me, give me, deliverance
Brother, sister, give me, give me
Deliverance, deliver me

Let me sleep for awhile and dream of Avalon and the Beltane fires
And a silent kiss steals away into the mist and out to the lake
Where the sword will rise again from the water into the
Hands of the chosen one the righteous one
Forever and again

Give me, give me, give me, deliverance
Brother, sister, give me, give me
Deliverance, deliver me
Give me, give me, give me, deliverance
Brother, sister, give me, give me
Deliverance, deliver me

=====================================================
Grapes Of Wrath

The sweat upon his brow and the dirt worked into his hands
The dignity of labour upon a man's own land
The soil of his fathers passes on down through blood to hand
A man's right of birth to reap the harvest from his land

The breaking of his back to keep his dream alive
To work the change of season his instinct to survive
The planting of his seed and to see his harvest grow
Gives a pride to a man to reap the harvest that he sows

The land of the free, home of the brave
The heartland of pioneers, the heritage of flesh and blood
And along come the winds that blow through the land
With a price to pay for the working man
Money talks and changes hands
And money reaps the harvest money demands
The grapes of wrath

They can take away his freedom they can beat him into the dust
They can burn his home, run him from his land, and leave him out to gather rust
But they can't take away his faith and his honesty and pride
And the knowledge that he holds inside
One day they'll reap the harvest
The grapes of wrath

There's hope in a man that nothing can destroy
A man will endure anything for the dream that he holds dear
And there's pride in a man who knows the truth
His faith in the earth he toils for
His honesty for the air he breathes
The truth of the harvest they will reap
The grapes of wrath

=====================================================
Belief

All I ever need is the truth but I all ever want is affection
Masquerade as Jesus Christ and suffer the crucifixion
Lips that speak of love eternal come heal my savaged skin
Cast aside all thought of revenge searching for Nirvana within
And God only knows my belief holds strong
The wisdom comes when the heart suffers long
And I'm shedding tears for Judas a kiss may betray
And I'm on the side of angels on the heels of a dream a ghost to lay

A hard reign may fall and a cruel wind may blow
The moon may be pale and I may never know
The need for silence but I can see hope in the wind in the rain
Lay belief on me my angel child

The actor and the poet martyr castles carved in sand
Delight and the promise of Eden lay in the touch of your hand
As sweet as sin sweeter still the taste
The way of all flesh lay me to waste
And heaven knows that the meek shall inherit the earth
Lay belief on me my angel child

Behold a silent ocean in a precious grain of sand
And if I have to explain then you'll never understand
My petals are strewn scattered by the breeze
It's whispered in the wind echoes through the trees
Love's a disease and it rips me apart
Come heal my ravaged heart
Lay belief on me my angel child

=====================================================
Paradise (Will Shile Like The Moon Tonight)

Hey sister moonshine ride the snake with me
Ride it long ride it hard
Ride it all the way with me
Hey sister moondance charm the snake for me
Charm it long charm it hard
Charm the skin from its back for me
And paradise will come tonight
In the comfort of your arms and the ritual and
The rite
And paradise shines so bright
Lead me a dance of veil in the silver of the
Moonlight and paradise
Paradise will shine like the moon tonight

Hey sister moonchild the wolf is howling at the moon
He howls long he howls hard
Howling for you sister moon
Hey sister moonshine hold me till the break of dawn
Hold me long hold me hard
Hold me till the shadows fade away
Hey sister moonlight kiss me with your honey lips
Kiss me long kiss me hard
Kiss me till my honey drips
Hey sister midnight love is over with the rising sun
Love me long love me hard
This could be forever if you love me right

=====================================================
Hungry As The Hunter

Dressed as seduction she's curious and cruel
She steals her way into your trust
And first you want her kiss and then you want her more
And then she'll have you crawling in the dust
Don't speak to me of dignity don't speak to me of love
Don't talk to me of sanctity don't talk to me of love
She's hungry as the hunter and she's shooting for the thrill
She's hungry as the hunter and she shoots to kill

The swastika a grinning skull tattooed on your arm
The needle and the damage done
The heresy of romance with the lady in white
And the beautiful and damned die young
Don't count on me for sympathy don't come to me for love
Don't talk to me of liberty don't talk to me of love
She's hungry as the hunter and she's shooting for the thrill
She's hungry as the hunter she shoots to kill

You've gone to the devil god rest your soul
A shot in your arm is like a knife in my back
Addiction to the lady coursing through your veins
She holds the whip you love to crack
Don't talk to me of serenity don't talk to me of love
Don't speak to me of divinity don't speak to me of love
She's hungry as the hunter and she's prowling like the hound
She's hungry as the hunter she'll track you down
She's hungry as the hunter and she's shooting for the thrill
She's hungry as the hunter she shoots to kill

=====================================================
Lovely

I believe in angels
I believe in heaven
I believe in colours
I believe in sunshine
I believe in laughter
I believe in crying
I believe in magic
I believe in dreams
I believe in lovely
I believe in friends
I believe in love
I believe in peace
I believe in children
I believe in deliverance
I believe in me
But most of all I believe in you

=====================================================
Hands Across The Ocean

Every time I think of you it's like the last beat of my heart
The memory of leaving you is tearing me apart
No waves, no tears, no backward glance
But I'll always hold you dear
Never regret but I'll never forget
'Cause there's not enough heaven here

Hands across the ocean, reaching out for you
Across the waves, across the water
Hands, across the ocean
Ocean

And every time I'm missing you I just can't let it show
And every time I want to cry, I just can't let it go
Wine and song and masquerade and refuge holds me dear
Ribbons and lace and daisy chains
But there's not enough heaven here

Hands across the ocean, reaching out for you
Across the waves, across the water, reaching out for you
Hands across the ocean, reaching out for you
Across the waves, across the water
Hands, across the ocean

Bangles, beads and lipstick games
And comfort holds me dear
Velvet and lace and perfumed sheets
But there's not enough heaven
Not enough heaven here

Hands across the ocean, reaching out for you
Across the waves, across the water, reaching out for you
Hands across the ocean, reaching out for you
Across the waves, across the water
Hands, across the ocean
Ocean
Ocean
Ocean

Hands across the ocean, reaching out for you
Across the waves, across the water
Hands, across the ocean

=====================================================
The Grip Of Disease

Sometimes I feel just like Jesus Christ
Nailed to the cross, betrayed and crucified
A crown of thorns cutting into my skin
A palace and a throne and a kingdom of my own
Knights in armour and courtesans, maids in waiting with blood on their hands
The king ??? can't get blood from a stone

I'm falling, into the arms of Nemesis
I'm falling, into the grip of disease

Cold comfort is success and I can feel my blood freeze
Reason with the dust and blown away by the breeze
How cruel the stars, that shine so hard

I'm falling, into the arms of Nemesis
I'm falling, into the grip of

Disease

?? and all I ever need is the truth
But the truth of it all is that there's no truth at all
Like the truth of the cry from the new born child
So why? Just tell me why, does Jesus cry?

I'm falling, into the arms of Nemesis
I'm falling, into the grip of disease
I'm falling, into the arms of Nemesis
I'm falling, into the grip of disease

Disease, disease, disease

=====================================================
Divided We Fall

I'm the father of a bastard child and I'm not talking about my daughter
I feel that my head's on the chopping block, like a lamb being led
Being led to slaughter

I close my eyes but sleep won't come and now I've got the devil to pay
I'm so sick and tired of this masquerade
How many loaves?? do you think I can bleed?

Do you feel? Do you feel it at all?
'Cause together we stand but divided we fall

I lower my guns to play Russian roulette
But I'm too damn scared to pull the trigger
'Cause a bullet in the head would leave me dead
And it's better to live as a rock and roll nigga

Do you feel? Do you feel it at all?
'Cause together we stand but divided we fall

The monkey fights a mother(?) like a man fights himself
And it's always a fight without a winner
Those endless lines on the way to hell
'Cause heaven never welcomes a sinner

Do you feel? Do you feel it at all?
'Cause together we stand but divided we fall
Do you feel? Do you feel it at all?
'Cause together we stand but divided we fall

=====================================================
Mercenary

You're a sycophantic, bullshitting, cock sucking, arse licking, mercenary
Mind numbing, money grabbing, motherfucking scum of the earth, mercenary
You're a cringing, grovelling chicken shit, pissing waste of time
You're a crawling, whining hypocrite, you fucking piece of slime
You can take the money and run, but there's nowhere you can hide
You arsehole mercenary

Send you woman I done by
But you took me for a ride, you shitty mercenary
You're a parasite of the fucking world, cockroach I wanna kill
If I don't catch you first then instant karma will
So screw you, fuck you
Screw you, fuck you
You're a cringing, grovelling chicken shit, pissing waste of time
You're a crawling, whining hypocrite, you fucking piece of slime

Mr Pleasant

Oh, Mr. Pleasant, how is Mrs. Pleasant?

'Cause the whole wide world is on your side, hey hey

How are you today? People say Mr. Pleasant's good, Mr. Pleasant's kind
Mr. Pleasant's OK, Mr. Pleasant don't mind
As long as Mr. Pleasant's alright, hey hey

Do you like prosperity more than you like poverty?

Life is easier, so much easier, life is easier, now

Oh, Mr. Pleasant, how is Mrs. Pleasant? Did you know she was flirting
Around with a lovely young man? And he's taking her out, when you
Have to work late
So it's not so pleasant after all, hey hey

Mr. Pleasant's OK, Mr. Pleasant don't mind
As long as Mr. Pleasant's alright, hey hey

How are you today? La la la...
As long as Mr. Pleasant's alright, hey hey

Kingdom Come (Forever And Again)

Desert rat cry me wolf
Shedding skin upon you lips
I pray
For the love of madness
For the hand that takes the grip
And we close our eyes
To forgive and forget
And we close our eyes
To forgive and forget
With bated breath for the kingdom come
With bated breath for the kingdom come

I build myself a brave asylum
And ask all the madmen to play host
And when the colours all fade away
It's time for us to give the ghost
Give up the ghost

And we close our eyes
To dream a while
And we close our eyes
To dream a while
Dream a while
With bated breath for the kingdom come
With bated breath for the kingdom come

And while we're talking in tongues
Of animal behaviour
With a flick of the wrist you could've broken my heart
And done yourself a favour
And I cry in the heat
For the promised and given

The hand I once would trust
Now for the love of heaven
You won't see me
See me for dust

And we close our eyeas
To love again
And we close our eyes
To love again
Love again
With bated breath for the kingdom come
With bated breath for the kingdom come
With bated breath for the kingdom come
With bated breath for the kingdom come

=====================================================
Heaven Sends You

I'll kiss the sleep from your eyes
I'll kiss you when the sun goes down
I'll kiss your until sunrise
I'll kiss the skin from your lips
And I'll kiss you on your fingertips
And I'll kiss you on the back of your neck
And I'll kiss you behind your ears
And I'll kiss away your tears and fears
And I'll kiss away those hurting years
And I'll kiss away those cruel dark hours
And I'll kiss the petals on your flower
I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you
I'll kiss you until heaven sends you

I'll kiss you between your toes
I'll kiss you on the bottom of your feet
I'll run my tongue across your back
I'll kiss you behind your naked knees
I'll kiss your breast, I'll drink your milk
I'll run my tongue between your lips
I'll kiss you, kiss you, kiss you on your sex
And I'll take you, take you, take you in my mouth
And I'll kiss you, kiss you until heaven sends you

=====================================================
Sweet Smile Of A Mystery

Man seeks the wisdom of woman
Man needs the comfort of her breast
Like a babe in arms, a suckling child
She keeps me safe and warm
In pressing it on test it(?) and strong
She stands before me naked and bare
But woman
You are the sweet smile of a mystery to me

Woman reaches out across eternity
She brings out the hope, the fear and the child
She brings out the very essence of me
She's the maid of heaven, she's mother of earth
She's nature's child, she's the virgin birth
She's my sister, she's my mother
She's my daughter and she's my lover
But woman, woman
You are the sweet smile of a mystery to me

=====================================================
Love

Love is real, real is love
Love is feeling, feeling love
Love is wanting to be loved
Love is touch, touch is love
Love is reaching, reaching love
Love is asking to be loved
Love is you, you and me
Love is knowing we can be
Love is free, free is love
Love is living, living love
Love is needing to be loved

=====================================================
Bird Of Passage

There's a lump in my throat and an ache in my heart
There's tears in my eyes, 'cos we're an ocean apart
There's nothing quite as real as being on my own
Nothing quite as true as being all alone
This bird has flown
But when the summer has passed she'll come back home

Love, come wing your way
Sweet bird of passage, come home to stay
Love, come wing your way
Sweet bird of passage, come home to lay with me
May you stay with me forever

With the change of seasons, she flies her nest
And like the sun at dusk, she sets to the west
Loneliness is the cross I bear
Solitude is the cloak I wear
I miss you, I need you, I love you
When the autumn comes I'll be waiting for you

Love, come wing your way
Sweet bird of passage, come home to stay
Love, come wing your way
Sweet bird of passage, come home to lay with me
May you stay with me forever
Forever, forever, forever

=====================================================
Never Again

It's never been like this
It's never been like this, no I've never felt like this before

And it was just around sunrise when you crept out the door
Left me ragged and worn but left me
Left me wanting more, more, more
Let's do this all again
Let's do this all again
Let's do it all again
Let's do this all again, do it all again sometime
Sometime

And do you remember Paris in the rain?
And it looks just like Christmas
But that's come and gone again
And the wild cats roaming in among the tombs and graves
And the flickering white neon of the cross and "Jesus Saves"
And the headlights like fires and the crowds in the streets
Children dressed in rags begging at our feet
And we crawled back to our room
With our heads spinning 'round
And we just lay in the dark
And didn't dare make a sound
And a sorrow soft as whispers stole into our hearts
Lay down between us and pushed us apart
And do you remember the silence scorched with pain?
A burning regret, let's never do this again
Again
Let's never do this again

=====================================================
Shades Of Green (Part II)

I'm lying in the dark listening to the rain
Reminds of you and makes me me sad all over again
Your measured swoons and sighs
Your hand me down whispered alibis

And it's easy to forgive but it's so hard, so hard to forget
And it's easy to see how deceit, deceit becomes regret
I can see now we're apart
How your mind played tricks on my heart

I never knew that you were untrue
There's so many shades of green
And I never believed that you would ever deceive
There's so many shades of green, so many shades of green

So sleep with your snakes and enjoy their viper's kiss
I want you know there's nothing about that I miss
I don't wish you any pain
But I don't ever want to see you again

So just shut your mouth
I've heard it all before
Shut it, just shut it
I don't wanna hear any more

I never knew that you were untrue
There's so many shades of green
And I never believed that you would ever deceive
There's so many shades of green
And you never knew that I was also untrue
There's so many shades of green
And you never believed that I could ever deceive
There's so many shades
So many shades of green

=====================================================
Even You May Shine

Some crazy holy roller trying to sell you Jesus
Trying to sell you helter skelter
He sells you genocide, he sells you kingdom come
Now watch the little piggies run for shelter
Cease to exist, just come and say you love me

Welcome to the family, meet Sadie and Gypsy
They'll creepy crawly under your skin
And every time a bell tolls, and you've blood on your hands
An angel, an angel gets her wings
Cease to exist, just come and say you love me

And you had Jesus until I came along
So come and join this freak show of mine
There's a place for you with us, a place for you in Heaven
All that glitters is not gold, in Heaven
Even you may shine

He preaches revelation, chapter and verse
And all dead swine grow up a sacred cow
Too many Christ's and never enough crosses
Who shall we crucify now?
Cease to exist, just come and say you love me

Shine on

=====================================================
Trail Of Scarlet

It was the word from Milo, A word to the wise
That set me straight about your cheating and your lies
Set down between us like the bottle that we shared
He had to tell me because noone else dared
I'm so disappointed
I'm so very, very let down

And you can have the bed and the stains on the sheets
I'll sleep on the floor, I can't bear your deceit
You gave yourself away for the sake of a thrill
For the price of my conceit, you were a steal
I'm so devastated
I'm so very, very let down

You leave a trail of scarlet like footsteps in the snow
You leave a trail of scarlet everywhere you go
And I'm the last to know

And isn't it just like you to shake the faith in me?
I gave you all I have to give but I couldn't give you all you need
And something that had died was all we had to lose
And the worst thing I ever did to you was ask you to choose
I'm so very lonely
I'm so very, very let down

You leave a trail of scarlet like footsteps in the snow
You leave a trail of scarlet everywhere you go and I'm
The last to know

And didnt we once have it all? held it in our hands
But its too easy to deceive a trust that makes no demands

You leave a trail of scarlet like footsteps in the snow
You leave a trail of scarlet everywhere you go and I'm the last to know

=====================================================
Spider And The Fly

Save me, save me, save me from the spider, begs the fly
I'm caught in her web and she's bleeding me dry
She wears her seduction like the bride wears her veil
She promised me Heaven but all she gives me is Hell

Oh no, no she's pulling me under
She's dragging me down, tearing me asunder
I'm sweating hot steel bullets, my mouth is bone dry
My heart beats too fast,can't catch my breath
The spider the spider traps the fly

She dresses in white but her heart's as black as sin
Her legs are wrapped around me feel her crawl across my skin
As she sucks the life outta me. I can't fly anymore
And I shiver and I shudder and surrender to the whore

Oh no, no, no, no, no she's dragging me under
She's pulling me down, tearing me asunder
I'm sweating hot steel bullets, my mouth, my mouth is bone dry
My heart beats too fast, can't catch my breath
The spider, the spider's trapped the fly

=====================================================
She Conjures Me Wings

I've been too drunk to love
Too drunk to care
I've looked like death, felt like hell
Been the worse for wear
I've been drinking too much to remember
The hell of the night before
I've been drinking myself blind
And still I'll drink some more

She is the wine that makes harps and choirs
The sweetest sound that the grapevine brings
She is the wine that makes gods and angels
And when I drink of her, she conjures me wings

She invites me to her banquets
And I feast on her bouquet
She chases the dragons, and
Drives the demon away
She builds a rainbow bridge
To the island of the blessed
She leads me to surrender
To the quarry of my quest

She is the temptress
The master magician
A sister to eros
She is exhibition
She plays like a symphony
Smells like sympathy
Tastes like poetry
Gives her very soul to me

=====================================================
Sticks And Stones

I know I am a legend 'cause I've seen my name
Slandered on a dirty subway wall
Sticks and stones may break my bones but names don't hurt
Names can't hurt me at all

You can crucify me
I will rise again
You can crucify me
I will stand alone

You bask in the light that pours from me
But that's just the way the world is mine
That's just the way all stars must shine

Assassination by vitriol and your quill is a loaded gun
Your finger on the trigger baby, trigger baby, trigger baby
But your dumb dumb bullets, dumb dumb bullets
Can never hurt anyone

=====================================================
Like A Child Again

I'm not scared anymore
I'm not scared of the dark when I sleep with you
And I'm feeling alive
And I'm feeling strong again when I'm with you
And it hits me
Just like a runaway train
And it blows me away
Just like a hurricane
You make me happy and I hope you feel the same
You make me feel just like a child, a child again

I'm not trapped anymore
Between madonna and the whore when I lay with you
And the days run away
Like wild horses run away when I'm with you

And I'm breathing you in
Just like the morning air
And I'm wrapping you around
Just like a skin to wear
You make me happy and I hope you feel the same
You make me feel just like a child, a child again

Oh sweet thing
I'm born once again
For you sweet thing
Just like a baby again
You make me happy and I hope you feel the same
And I'm in heaven and it feels like a gentle rain
You make me happy and I want you to feel the same
You make me feel just like a child
A child again

=====================================================
You Make Me Breathe

I never knew how much you could mean to me
Until the moment you saw how untrue I could be
I never meant to cause you sorrow
Never meant to cause you any pain
But with all the best intentions
I can't promise I won't do it again

I don't know what it is that drives me to make me want to throw it all away
'Cause you're really very precious, and I do so dearly want you to say
It gets harder all the time, to be away from you
And I want to work it out, so you can grow to trust me too
Like I trust you

Time is not the healer, I was hoping he would be
And I'm still tender and bruised, but I want you to touch me
'Cause there's a healing in your touch
And you're the one I need to be with
I want to give myself to you, give you all I have to give
You make me live
You make me breathe
You make me breathe

=====================================================
Until There's Another Sunrise

Buried deep, buried deep inside
The hurting and the pain I've got to hide
It's cold and it's dark and it's raining outside
Never another sunset until there's another
Another sunrising up
Like a mountain from the sea
Against the pain
The walls I build, the bridges I burn
So I'll never get hurt again
It's cold and it's dark and I'm feeling numb
Never another sunrise until there's another
Another healing time come

Hiding away in my ivory tower, my fortress, my sanctuary
Until the healing comes, quiet and sure, like a mistress visiting me
It's cold and it's lonely but there's a light shining in my eyes
There's another sunset until there's another
Until there's another sunrise

=====================================================
All Tangled Up In You

When the evening falls comes the sadness of the moon
And the deepest darkest ocean of your eyes
And the sorrow and regret in the whisper of your voice
Betrays a lie that healing comes with touch
And you say hush, baby hush, you say something you'll regret
Never promise anyone forever
Close your eyes and dream and try to forget
The paradise comes, but never forever
And I'm all tangled up in you

The blinding delight that is yours to bestow
You hide it away deep inside your heart
Like blows to a bruise and yes, I got scarred
The haunting past is holding us apart
And I'm all tangled up in you
And I'm all tangled up, all tangled up, tangled up in you

I know you're scared of giving yourself and being bounded by love
But love doesn't have to be shackles and chains
You don't have to promise me anything, but I'll take anything you give
'Cause there's so much more than I've ever known
So much more than I've ever hoped
And if

As the thought of you plays gently and sublime
You weaved into my dreams and all I feel
And the colours you parade are designs for your charade
But I glimpse beneath your veil and you rebuild
A trembling, fragile heart and a yearning to be adored
If only you believe I feel the same way as you
To take shelter in my arms and sleep the sleep of angels
If only you believe I'm all tangled up in you
And I'm all tangled up in you
And I'm all tangled up, all tangled up in you
And I'm all tangled up, all tangled up in you
And I'm all tangled up, all tangled up in you
And I'm all tangled up, all tangled up, tangled up in you

=====================================================
Atomic

Ah ha, make me tonight
Tonight, make it right
Ah ha, make me tonight
Tonight

Oh

Ah ha, make it magnificent
Tonight
Whoa

Ah, your hair is beautiful
Ah, tonight
Atomic

Tonight, make it magnificent
Tonight, make me tonight

Your hair is beautiful
Whoa, tonight
Atomic, oh ah
Atomic, oh ah

Oh ah, atomic
Oh ah, atomic
Oh ah

Raising Cain

I'm sick and tired of this masquerade
I'm bored to death by the games we play
For to long now it's been a charade
Don't wanna stay around to piss on parade

Gotta get the hell outta here
Too late now to wrap me up in chains
Too late now to bite my tongue, stop me
Raising Cain

The chip on your shoulder is a monkey on my back
You steal the glory, I'll take the flak
Can't stand your accusations, your recriminations

It's time to jump this train cos we've crashed the station

Don't wanna take this ride no more
Too late now to wrap me up in chains
Too late now to bite my tounge, stop me
Raising Cain

The gift of masque was like pearls before swine

Too late now to wrap me up in chains
Too late now to bite my tounge, stop me
Raising Cain

=====================================================
Sway

I'm not the animal I used to be but you
Shouldn't speak ill of the dead
I've never been just one of the boys, I've never hidden guns under the bed
I feel like Jesus, I feel betrayed, and you know
Damn well that I feel crucified
Assassination, shot full of vitrial, there's so
Many more heroic ways to die
I close my eyes and I start to drift away
I close my eyes and I start to sway

Lie back and think of England I'll just fake it some more
A carrion feast for the ravens and the crows
I know my price and I'll be your whore and I
Don't care if the whole damn world knows
I feel so jaded, so tired and so worn
I feel like I've got nothing left to say
I'll be a martyr, a brave little soldier cos
There's so many demons left to purge and slay
I close my eyes and I start to drift away
I close my eyes and I start to sway

Trapped in the eye of a hurricane
Taking a ride on a runaway train
Behind the wheel of a crashing car
Caught in the trail of a falling star
Can't turn my back without a blade digging deep
It's more than enough to make a grown man cry
The God in me is the, the devil in you, there's
Many more beautiful ways to die
I close my eyes and I start to drift away
I close my eyes and I start to sway

=====================================================
Lose Myself In You

When you touch me you save my life
I don't need redemption I don't want christ
All I've ever needed, all I've ever wanted is you
So hey baby rae you can elevate me
You can raise me up, you can make me see
The wonder and the innocence in everything
Little thing you do
I wanna lose myself, lose myself in you

When I look into your baby blue eyes
I can see the ocean, I can see the skies
I can see the sun and the moon and the
History of the world

You are the beacon, the guiding light
You are the hand that leads me through the
Night, you are the heaven's most beautiful and
Brightest star
I wanna lose myself, lose myself in you

I never knew I could feel like this
I never knew I could feel this way again
I never knew it could be like this
I never knew I could feel this way again
So believe in me cos I believe in you
Yes, I believe in you
I wanna lose myself, lose myself in you

=====================================================
Swoon

, more than adore you
Naked, standing before you
Hold out your arms
And open yourself wide
Hold me dear
Bury me deep inside
Feel, feel the glow
You make me swoon

I, wanna turn you on
Wanna take you high
Sleight of hand
Slip of the tongue

Sweet, how sweet you taste

And the heat
The heat you make
You make me swoon, you make me swoon

I, more than adore you
Naked, standing before you
Hush, baby hush
Rush, here comes the rush
You make me swoon, you make me swoon
You make me swoon, you make me swoon

=====================================================
Wasting Away

Cloaked in black like the stars, so wrapped up in yourself you are
The needle taste sweeter by far than the cold light of day
And as you become enslaved to the puppy that you grief
There is nothing I can do to save you from slipping away
And I just wanted, just needed to say
I hate to see you wasting away, just wasting away

So when you just can't take anymore and the nappy comes too full of pain
You reach for the comfort of your white stallion again
And I just wanted, just needed to say
I hate to see you wasting away, just wasting away
Just wasting away

I've seen the fire die away, I've seen the sunset in your eyes
I've seen the darkness coming down and I just needed to say good bye

So you're dancing with the candy man, he's saving the last words for you
And as he leads you away by the hand there is nothing I can do
There is nothing I can do
Goodbye to you, goodbye to you

=====================================================
Stars Don't Shine Without You

I'll cry myself to sleep 'cause you're not here by my side
I'll cry 'cause you're not with me, with me tonight
I'll cry myself a river and drown in a torrent of tears
I'll cry 'cause the stars have thrown down all their spears
The stars don't shine without you
And it makes me, makes me sad and blue
The stars don't shine without you
And there's nothing, no nothing I can do
I'll cry 'cause the stars don't shine for me no more

=====================================================
Celebration

Let's dance around in circles
Let's dance around the maypole
Let's welcome the season
Let's celebrate Mama Nature's bountiful soul
Let's feast at her banquet
Give thanks and let the good times roll
Come on and join hands
Come on with me and my May Queen
Come and bang your drum
Come and shake your ass and tambourine
Rejoice and let's get merry
Come on and let's dig this scene
Let's all come together on this celebration day

=====================================================
Cry Like A Baby

Well I can't take it, take it anymore
Everyone I know is a pimp or a whore
As ugly as sin and as sleazy as hell
Everyone I know has got trash to sell
From the mouth's of babes come the words of the wise
Please don't ask me to apologise
Load up your gun to play Russian roulette
I'll take another drag on your funny cigarette
And I'll cry like a baby

Rally the troops, the battle lines are drawn
The darkest hour comes before dawn
Don't you talk to me of self respect
Cos all I hear is cause and effect
I've got no bridges left to burn
Got no place left to turn
I'm a shooting star ready to crash
Don't want your credit I'll just take your cash
And I'll cry like a baby

Crawl back under your stone hide your face in shame
Look to yourself cos I'm too easy to blame
The smell of burning martyr, stench of decay
I'll trample over you if you get in my way
And I'll cry like a baby

=====================================================
Swim With The Dolphins

I wanna fly with Peter Pan
I wanna go with Alice to Wonderland
I wanna pitch ball to Shoeless Joe
I wanna roam the plains with the buffalo
Ohoh, ohoh, and before I die
Ohoh, ohoh, and before I die all I wanna do
Is swim with the dolphins

I wanna fly with Peter Pan
I wanna go with Alice to Wonderland
I wanna walk the Yellow Brick Road
I wanna buy back the dreams I sold
Ohoh, ohoh, and before I die
Ohoh, ohoh, and before I die all I wanna do
Is swim with the dolphins

=====================================================
Neverland (Vocal)

Sometimes I feel so old I wanna die
Feel like I'm sick at heart
Sometimes I just wanna break down and cry
Feel like I'm falling apart
Angel come and rescue me
Angel come and take my hand
Angel come and rescue me
Come and take my hand, come with me to Neverland

Sometimes I feel like a candle burning down
Feel like my flame is getting dim
Sometimes I feel like a ship that's run aground
Feel like I'm twisted by the wind
Angel come and rescue me
Angel come and take my hand
Angel come and rescue me
Come and take my hand, come with me to Neverland

So weary and so tired I close my eyes but sleep just won't come
So messed up and wired, I feel so old and I
Wanna die, feel so cold and I'm sick of trying
Feel so cold, feel so numb
Angel come and rescue me
Angel come and take my hand
Angel come and rescue me
Come and take my hand, come with me to Neverland
Angel come and rescue me
Angel come and take my hand
Angel come and rescue me
Come and take my hand, come with me to Neverland

=====================================================
Daddy's Going To Heaven Now

Come close my baby girl
I've got something I need to say
I'll miss you my darling child
I'm so sorry I gotta go away
So say goodbye 'cause daddy's going to heaven now
So say goodbye 'cause daddy's going to heaven now

Remember I've no regrets
Remember I'll never forget
You gave me joy and blind delight
You gave me faith and shone so bright
You gave me reason and I'm proud of you
Be good, be strong, be honest and true
So say goodbye cos daddy's going to heaven now
Say goodbye 'cause daddy's going to heaven now
Say goodbye 'cause daddy's going to heaven now
Say goodbye 'cause daddy's going to heaven now
Say goodbye 'cause daddy's going to heaven
Now

I'm so tired now, so frail and so weak
I've been fighting so long I need release
I've never been scared, scared to die
Don't mourn for me, don't even cry
'Cause when sleep comes to end this pain
I know in my heart I will see you again
So say goodbye 'cause daddy's going to heaven now
Say goodbye 'cause daddy's going to heaven now
Say goodbye 'cause daddy's going to heaven now
Say goodbye 'cause daddy's going to heaven now
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye

=====================================================
Afterglow

Lay down your arms and surrender to mine
Let me release you from your tangled skein
Burn down your temples and your holy shrines
Sift through the ashes for the truth that shines
No more weeping or wringing of hands
Come with me to the promised land
Close your eyes and we'll go down slow
We're gonna drown in the afterglow

In the aftermath of Babylon
All the pimps and whores have gone
All the guilt has been laid to rest
Just remember mother never knew best
Tear down the walls raze them to the ground
Your ivory tower we'll burn it down
And in the evening when the sun gets low
We're gonna drown in the afterglow

=====================================================
Coming Home

Sweet Jesus come & save me
I've been weak & gone astray
Take me down to the water &
Wash my sins away
Sweet Jesus I believe
I have no faith in the word you say
Make me clean, make me pure again
Make me ready for the judgment day

I'm coming home, coming home
I'm coming home, home to you

Lay my hands on the Bible & swear to
The good Lord above
I'll make amends for my sinful ways
& give myself up to your love

No more whiskey or whoring
Or fighting like an alley cat
Cos' in the eyes of the Lord it don't
Matter where you're from
It just matters where you're at

I ain't always been an honest man &
I've never been as white as snow
Travel a dark & dirty road
Then you reap just what you sow
Sweet Jesus be my saviour
Come & lay your hands on me
Count me in for the resurrection
Heaven for eternity

=====================================================
Get Back To You

Minnie Mouse grins her Cheshire cat grin
The cat who's got the cream dribbling down her chin
Valentine sleeps in a heap on the floor
Give the dog a bone and she'll come back for more
The man in the moon is swinging in the breeze
Hanging like a fruit from the never-green tree
The face in the window is familiar and sad
My head is pounding and it's driving me mad

And I don't know how I feel anymore
Cos there's nothing left to hold on to
And I don't know what is real anymore
I wish I could get back, wish I could get back to you

Faith hope and charity hanging in the hall
The genius of Dylon Rae tacked to the wall
There's a chill in the hair and it feels like snow
Better wrap up warm if you're planning to go

And I don't know how I feel anymore
Cos there's nothing left to hang on to
And I don't know what is real anymore
I wish I could get back, wish I could get back to you

Monkey see monkey do
I wanna be like you
Monkey see monkey do

=====================================================
Drown In Blue

Ravaged, by the lines of age
Too many appetites to sate
Blue and as dark as death
Been swimming too long
Can't catch my breath
I'm going down again
Don't wanna drown again like this
Don't wanna fall apart like this
Can't let the world see me like this

Hollow, empty as a promise
Don't get no pleasure from this
Sorrow, as cold as snow
Been holding on too long, can't let it go
Tears me asunder again
I'm going under again
Got no one but myself to blame
It's dragging me down into the Blue
I'm slipping under without you
So please don't leave me here again

=====================================================
Damaged

So you find it hard to face the cold harsh light of day
Hiding in the shadows of resentment and blame
The argument for violence over reason holds no sway
No matter what you promise I don't think you'll ever change
Damaged, you're oh so damaged

So you can't exist without your powder and pornography
It's a dangerous place where the white line makes you go
Armed with wide-eyed logic and a hand-me-down biography
There's a devil inside when the mirror's covered in snow
Damaged, oh so damaged

Don't you think you're taking just a little too much for granted
Crawling from the wreckage of another crashed car
And don't you think you're taking just a little too much advantage
Climbing up to heaven just to piss on the stars
Damaged, oh so damaged

=====================================================
More Than This

Don't care none for temptation
It's like the good lord jesus said
Lock horns with the devil himself and
You'll end up in his bed
And where there are no shadows
No demons can ever exist
Would you throw this all away
For the sake of a wanton kiss?

There must be more than this
There must be more than this

I know you think you walk on water
But have you ever walked on air?
Cast no aspersion, this ain't no desertion
This is just calling it fair
And when temptation takes a hold of you
How can you ever resist?
Would you throw this all away for the flick
Of a perfumed wrist?

Judge not lest ye be judged, let
He who has no sin throw the first stone
Shower me with flowers, place them on my grave
Give me the grace for the sins I atone
I don't know the difference 'tween right and wrong, I
Don't understand the sense of regret and virtue
I want you to know never meant to cause you harm
I'm sorry but I never meant yo hurt you

=====================================================
The Tears Shall Drown The Wind

I can't believe that you've been faking all this time
That's such a spiteful thing to say
I can't believe you never really cared
How am I supposed to know that you feel this way?

I don't see how it matters now
That tears shall drown the wind
I don't see why it makes you cry
That tears shall drown the wind

I never promised you that the stars would come to us
You have to know I never lied
I know you feel it's like waiting for the end of the world
Sometimes it's easy just to let it, let it slide

There ain't no sense in making accusations
No matter if you're wrong you're always right
There ain't no point in recrimination
I really don't have the strength to put up a fight

=====================================================
Black And Blue

It's always the same, I'm always to blame
Your accusations leave me numb
And how I regret how you always forget
The violence and damaged done

I could never explain, the seduction of pain
It's like a bad drug I can't hick
And how can I resist when you seduce with your fists?
Boys will be boys when the blood runs quick

You always bring me down, you always bring me down
It's a mystery to me how cruel you can be
You always bring me down, you always bring me down
But I come crawling back to you and then you beat me
Black and blue, black and blue

=====================================================
Alpha Man

It's never just a war of words
There's always some kind of hidden agenda
All you ever want from me
Is a white flag and a quiet surrender
This could be for ever more
As long as I succumb & suffer in silence
Love is like a battlefield
Where words are soldiers & talk is violence

I'm just doing the best I can
But I'm not your alpha man
I'm doing the best I can
But I'm not your alpha man

All you ever want me to be
Is another dead butterfly to add to your collection
Trapped in the killing jar
Tethered and bound to your idea of perfection

=====================================================
Cannibal

The hounds are a-howlin' and the moon is so full
How bright are the stars whilst the dark can be so cruel
Hunting for prey across this ocean of a night
Capture and devour, come and sate your appetite

Cast your spell, I'll be a victim for you
Can't your smell, another victim for you?

Throw me on the fire and I'll melt in the heat
The smell of burning flesh has never quite been so sweet
Tear the meant from the bone and leave nothing to waste
Have yourself a feast cos you're now got the taste

Cast your spell, I'll be a victim for you
Can't your smell, another victim for you?
Can't you tell, I'll be a victim for you?
So eat well, another victim for you

I wanna be seduced and ravaged
Your voodoo's working on me
I wanna be debauched and savaged
Come and work your voodoo on me

=====================================================
Dying Room

My mommy don't want me, daddy don't want me too
Nobody wants me, left me in the dying room

I ain't seen sunshine, never felt the rain
Never tasted joy, but I know pain

So please don't leave me, in this god forsaken hole
Please believe me, don't wanna die here alone

You stand accused, wish I'd never been born
Feel so abused, no one to mourn, the dying room

My mommy don't love me, daddy don't love me too
Nobody loves me, dying in the dying room

You turn away, and you shield your eyes
Feel so betrayed, feel so despised, in the dying room

=====================================================
Evermore And Again

I can taste your lipstick
I can feel your breath
I can feel the shivers running down my spine
I can feel your heartbeat
I can feel your hand
I can feel your fingers dancing down my spine

I give myself to you heart and soul
Flesh and blood forevermore

I can taste your sex
I can feel your heat
I can see the fire burning in your eyes
I can taste your sweetness
I can feel your joy
I can see the flames dancing in your eyes

I give myself to you heart and soul
Flesh and blood forevermore

=====================================================
